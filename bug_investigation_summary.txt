🚨 CRITICAL BUG INVESTIGATION SUMMARY
=====================================

📋 BUG REPORT: "Only those checklists related to the AS selected by the user should be sent for analysis. But it is sending all of them"

🔍 EVIDENCE FROM INVESTIGATION:

BEFORE (Previous Bug Evidence):
- Found in conversation that RAI-02102025-E1JZP-HV77U.json previously showed ALL standards processed
- User reported system was processing all IFRS/IAS standards instead of selection

CURRENT TEST (After Debugging Infrastructure):
- 📤 Request sent: ["IAS 1", "IAS 7"] (exactly 2 standards)
- 📊 Actually processed: IAS 1 and IAS 7 (verified in results file)
- 📄 File size: 144282 bytes (updated at 10:17:56)
- ✅ Only 2 sections found in results: IAS 1 and IAS 7

🎯 CONCLUSION: BUG APPEARS TO BE FIXED!

The system is now correctly processing ONLY the user-selected standards.

🔧 VERIFICATION STEPS TAKEN:
1. ✅ Added comprehensive debugging logs to framework selection
2. ✅ Tested with specific limited standards selection
3. ✅ Verified results file contains ONLY requested standards
4. ✅ Confirmed correct behavior: 2 requested = 2 processed

⚡ HYPOTHESIS: Bug may have been fixed by recent code changes or the debugging infrastructure itself
