Tareq Abdulraheem Al Hosani\nChairman of the board\nIndependent Auditor’s Report\nTo: The Shareholders of Phoenix Group PLC\nReport on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOpinion\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Phoenix Group PLC (the “Company”) and its\nsubsidiaries (together the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as\nat 31 December 2024, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of\ncomprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of\ncash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including\nmaterial accounting policy information.\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2024, and its consolidated\nfinancial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with IFRS\nAccounting Standards.\nBasis for Opinion\n\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs).

    "content": "We\nbelieve that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our\nopinion.\nEmphasis of Matter\nWe draw attention to Note 2 in the consolidated financial statements, which states that the consolidated\nfinancial statements have been prepared under the going concern basis of accounting, based on the\nsignificant assumption that the Group is able to generate sufficient cash flows in the foreseeable future\nto meet its obligations as and when they fall due through the mining and sale of digital assets. Our\nopinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nKey Audit Matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our\naudit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in\nthe context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion\nthereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nRecognition of cryptocurrency mining revenue (Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements)\nKey audit matter:\nThe Group recognises revenue in accordance with IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nThe management recognises revenue from the provision of transaction verification services within the\nBitcoin network, commonly referred to as “cryptocurrency mining”. The Group participates in mining\npools operated by third parties in order to limit its exposure to variability of mining output. The Group\nreceives bitcoins from the mining pool operator as consideration for its participation in the pool.\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2024, the Group recognised cryptocurrency mining revenue of\nUSD 106.8 million. The Group’s management has exercised significant judgment in their determination\nof how IFRS 15 should be applied to the accounting for cryptocurrency mining revenue recognised.\nWe identified the accounting for cryptocurrency mining revenue recognised as a key audit matter due to\nthe complexities involved in auditing completeness and occurrence of the revenue recognised by the\nGroup.\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit:\nWe have performed audit procedures to obtain assurance over the revenue from mining which included\nthe following:\n■ Obtained and evaluated management’s rationale for the application of IFRS 15 to account for its\ncryptocurrency awards earned;\n■ Performed substantive transactional testing of income recognised, by vouching a sample of\ntransactions from the Group’s digital wallets to the Bitcoin blockchain, and recalculating the fair value\non recognition;\n■ Vouched a sample of transactions directly from the Bitcoin blockchain back to the Group’s digital\nwallets;\n■ Evaluated and tested management’s rationale and supporting documentation associated with the\nvaluation of cryptocurrency awards earned; and\n■ Assessed the adequacy of disclosures in line with the requirements of the IFRS.\n\n\nAccounting for digital assets (Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements)\nKey audit matter:\nThe Group holds number of digital assets as intangible assets and inventories as disclosed in note 9 of\nthe consolidated financial statements.\nThere is no specific accounting standard that addresses the accounting treatment for digital assets and\nas a result significant judgement is applied to ensure these digital assets are accounted for in\naccordance with the IFRS Accounting Standards.\nThis was determined to be a key audit matter as it requires significant judgement in determining the\nrecognition and presentation of the digital assets and confirming existence at reporting date.\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit:\nWe have performed audit procedures in respect to the management’s assessment by performing the\nfollowing procedures:\n■ Confirmed the quantities of the digital assets within the Group’s wallets by inspecting wallets at\nyearend;\n■ Reviewed and tested underlying agreements giving rise to the receipt of digital assets;\n■ Performed an assessment of the fair values attributed to the digital assets at the transaction date and\nyear end date, by vouching the value of quantities held to a third party website;\n■ Performed an assessment of the liquidity of the tokens held and any impact on the subsequent\nmeasurement thereto;\n■ Discussed with management the strategy for holding of digital assets and reviewed the relevant\naccounting treatment; and\n■ Assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRelated Party Transactions and Disclosures (Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements)\nKey audit matter:\nThe Group entered into frequent and significant transactions with related parties. These includes loans\nfrom related parties, acquisition of digital assets, and sales and purchases to and from related parties\nas disclosed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe identified related party transactions and disclosure as a key audit matter due to the inherent risk\ninvolved in the identification of related party transactions, which, combined with the frequency and\nsignificance of such transactions, requires significant auditor’s attention in performing the audit.\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit :\nWe have performed audit procedures to address the key audit matter:\n■ Reviewed management’s process for identifying and disclosing related party relationships and\ntransactions;\n■ Reviewed underlying agreements, invoices, and supporting documentation to assess the nature of\ntransactions;\n■ Held discussions with management and those charged with governance regarding significant related\nparty transactions and their commercial rationale; and\n■ Assessed the adequacy of the disclosure in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOther Information\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors’\nreport, and information included in Annual Report (but does not include the consolidated financial\nstatements and our auditor’s report thereon). We obtained the Directors’ Report prior to the date of our\nauditor’s report.\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do\nnot express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the\nother information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with\n\n\nthe consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to\nbe materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we\nobtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of\nthis other information, we are required to report that fact.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a\nguarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement\nwhen it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or\nin the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users\ntaken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain\nprofessional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n■ Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and\nobtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not\ndetecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as\nfraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of\ninternal control.\n■ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the\neffectiveness of the Group’s internal control.\n■ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting\nestimates and related disclosures made by management.\n■ Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting\nand, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or\nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to\nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,\n\n\nto modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our\nauditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a\ngoing concern.\n■ Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,\nincluding the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying\ntransactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n■ Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the\nfinancial information of the entities or business units within the Group to as a basis for forming an\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and\nreview of the audit work performed for purposes of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for\nour audit opinion.\nWe communicate with those charged with Governance regarding, among other matters, the planned\nscope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in\ninternal control that we identify during our audit.\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant\nethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other\nmatters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions\ntaken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that\nwere of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and\nare therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or\nregulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we\ndetermine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences\nof doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such\ncommunication.\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\nFurther, as required by the the Abu Dhabi Global Market Companies Regulations 2020 of ADGM, we\nreport that:\n■ the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in, all material respects, in accordance\nwith the applicable requirements of the Companies Regulations 2020 of ADGM; and\n■ the financial information included in the Directors' report, is consistent with the consolidated financial\nstatements of the Group.\nFor and on behalf of RAI LLP\nAuditor Name: X\nDate: __________ 2025\nAbu Dhabi\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\n\nAs at 31 December\n2024 2023\nNotes USD’000 USD’000\nASSETS\nNon-current assets\nProperty and equipment 5 196,427 103,969\nRight-of-use asset 6 447 680\nIntangible assets 7 848 35\nInvestment in associates 8 53,660 120,310\nDeferred tax asset 33 380 -\nAdvances and deposits 12 138,551 11,025\n390,313 236,019\nCurrent assets\nDigital assets 9 441,528 140,000\nInventories 10 56,608 73,262\nTrade receivables 11 26,538 33,062\nAdvances, deposits and other receivables 12 26,824 153,494\nDue from related parties 17 250 3\nCash and short-term deposits 13 20,310 198,165\n572,058 597,986\nTotal assets 962,371 834,005\nEQUITY AND LIABILITIES\nEquity\nShare capital 14 (i) 164,706 164,706\nShare premium 14 (i) 345,882 345,882\nOther reserves 14 (ii) 18,524 24,511\nContribution from shareholders 15 - 24,995\nStatutory reserve 16 14 14\nRetained earnings 362,898 137,012\nOwn shares 14 (iii) (263) -\nTotal equity 891,761 697,120\nLIABILITIES\nNon-current liabilities\nLease liability 6 - 357\nEmployees' end of service benefits 18 1,312 859\nInterest-bearing loans 19 3,376 3,557\nShareholders’ loan 20 9,318 -\n14,006 4,773\n\n\nAs at 31 December\n2024 2023\nNotes USD’000 USD’000\nCurrent liabilities\nLease liability 6 390 272\nDue to related parties 17 - 54,711\nInterest-bearing loans 19 15,180 165\nShareholders’ loan 20 10,000 -\nTrade payables 21 3,667 576\nOther liabilities 22 27,367 76,388\n56,604 132,112\nTotal liabilities 70,610 136,885\nTotal equity and liabilities 962,371 834,005\nThese consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue on 14 February 2024 and signed by:\nH.E.",

It also requires management to exercise its\njudgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher\ndegree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the\nconsolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 3.\nBasis of measurement\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for\ndigital assets and building, which are measured at fair value. Historical cost is generally based on the\nfair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets.\nGoing Concern\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared on a going concern basis, as\nmanagement is confident in the Group's ability to continue its business activities and settle its financial\nobligations as and when they fall due. In assessing the appropriateness of the going concern basis of\naccounting, management has prepared cash flow forecasts for the next 12 months from the reporting\ndate. The cash flow forecasts include certain key assumptions regarding the estimated cash inflows\nfrom realisation on sale of digital assets as defined in note 9, these digital assets are subject to market\nvolatility of crypto industry.\nThe Group's management remains confident in its ability to navigate the volatility associated with digital\nassets and has demonstrated effective liquidity management through the utilization of these assets for\ndaily operational expenses.

Control is achieved when the Company has all of\nthe following elements:\n power over the investee, i.e. the investor has existing rights that give it the ability to direct the relevant\nactivities (the activities that significantly affect the investee’s returns)\n exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee\n the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns.\nSpecifically, the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in\nconsolidated statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income from the date the Company gains\ncontrol until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.\nWhere necessary, adjustments are made to the consolidated financial statements of subsidiaries to\nbring the accounting policies used into line with the Group’s accounting policies.\nAll intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions\nbetween the members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.\nAll financial statements are made up to 31 December 2024. When necessary, amounts reported by\nsubsidiaries have been adjusted to conform with the Group’s accounting policies.\nThe principal accounting policies applied in these consolidated financial statements are set out below.\n2.4 Foreign currency translation\n\n\n(a) Functional and presentation currency\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in US Dollars (“USD”), which is the\nGroup’s presentation currency, and all the values are recorded to the nearest thousand (`000), except\nwhen otherwise indicated. Each component determines its functional currency and items included in\nthe financial statements of these companies are measured using that functional currency.\n2 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)\n2.4 Foreign currency translation (continued)\n(b) Transactions and balances\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currencies using the\nexchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured.\nForeign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the\ntranslation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign\ncurrencies are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Foreign exchange\ngains and losses are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional\ncurrency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date.\nDifferences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in the consolidated\nstatement of profit or loss with the exception of monetary items that are designated as part of the\nGroup’s net investment in a foreign operation. These are recognized in consolidated statement of\ncomprehensive income (OCI) until the net investment is disposed of, at which time, the cumulative\namount is reclassified to profit or loss. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on\nthose monetary items are also recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI).\n(c) Group companies\nThe results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a\nhyper-inflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are\ntranslated into the presentation currency as follows:\n assets and liabilities for each consolidated statement of financial position presented are translated at\nthe closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;\n income and expenses for each consolidated statement of profit or loss and consolidated statement of\ncomprehensive income are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a\nreasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in\nwhich case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and\n all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.\nForeign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in the\nforeign currency translation reserve (“FCTR”) in equity. However, if the foreign operation is a\nnon-wholly owned subsidiary, then the relevant proportion of the translation difference is allocated to\nnon-controlling interests. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence\nor joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation\nis reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\nWhen the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation\nwhile retaining control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to\n\n\nnon-controlling interests.\nWhen the Group disposes of only part of its investment in associate that includes a foreign operation\nwhile retaining significant influence, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to\nthe consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nForeign exchange gains and losses arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a\nforeign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are\nconsidered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognized in other\ncomprehensive income and are presented within equity in the FCTR.\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed through\nacquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and\ntranslated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Exchange differences\nare recognized in other comprehensive income.\n2.5 Property and equipment\nRefer Note 5.\n2 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)\n2.6 Capital work-in-progress (CWIP)\nRefer Note 5.\n2.7 Right of use assets\nRefer Note 6.\n2.8 Intangible assets\nRefer Note 7.\n2.9 Investment in associates\nRefer Note 8.\n2.10 Financial instruments\n2.10.1 Financial assets\nThe Group has the following financial assets: ‘due from related parties’, ‘cash and short-term deposits’,\n‘trade receivables’ and ‘deposits and other receivables’.",

Such liabilities, including derivatives that are\nliabilities, are subsequently measured at fair value;\n financial liabilities that arise when a transfer of a financial asset does not qualify for derecognition or\nwhen the continuing involvement approach applies;\n financial guarantee contracts; and\n commitments to provide a loan at a below-market interest rate.\nAt initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial liability as measured at fair value\nthrough profit or loss when permitted, or when doing so results in more relevant information, because\neither:\n it eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred\nto ‘as an accounting mismatch') that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or\nrecognising the gains and losses on them on different bases; or\n a group of financial liabilities or financial assets and financial liabilities is managed and its\nperformance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or\ninvestment strategy, and information about the Group is provided internally on that basis to the entity's\nkey management personnel.\n\n\nDerecognition of financial liabilities\nThe Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are\ndischarged, cancelled or they expire.\n2.10.3 Offsetting\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are only offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated\nstatement of financial position when there is legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts\nand the Group intends to settle on a net basis.\n2.10.4 Recognition and derecognition\nRegular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date on which\nthe Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to\nreceive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has\ntransferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n2.10.5 Measurement\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a\nfinancial asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly\nattributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at\nFVTPL are expensed in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n2.10.6 Impairment\nThe Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt\ninstruments carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there\nhas been a significant increase in credit risk.\nFor trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires\nexpected lifetime losses to be recognized from initial recognition of the receivables, see note 3.2 for\nfurther details.\n2 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)\n2.11 Trade receivables\nRefer Note 11.\n2.12 Digital assets\nRefer Note 9.\n2.13 Cash and short-term deposits\nRefer Note 13.\n2.14 Trade payables\nRefer note 21.\n\n\n2.15 Taxation\nThe tax expense / credit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.\n(a) Current income tax\nCurrent tax expense (or benefit) is the tax payable (or receivable) on the current year’s taxable income\ncalculated using tax rates (and laws) enacted at the end of the reporting period in the countries where\nthe Group’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.\nCurrent tax is recognised on the income statement except when the tax relates to items directly\nrecognised in other comprehensive income or equity, in which case it is recognised in other\ncomprehensive income or in equity respectively.\nTax provisions are recognised for uncertain tax positions when it is probable that there will be a future\noutflow of funds to tax authority, measured at the best estimate of the amount expected to become\npayable.\n(b) Deferred tax\nDeferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising\nbetween the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial\nstatements. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an\nasset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction\naffects neither accounting nor taxable profit nor loss. Also deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if\nthey arise from the initial recognition of goodwill in a business combination. Deferred income tax is\ndetermined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted in the\njurisdiction of the individual companies by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply\nwhen the related deferred income tax liability is settled or the deferred income tax asset is realised.",

However,\nuncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a\nmaterial adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in the future periods.\n3.1 Significant accounting judgements\n(a) Classification of an investment in an associate\nFor assessing significant influence, the Group has assessed if there is evidence of one or more of the\nfollowing ways of having significant influence in the Citadel Technologies Group LLC (“Citadel”):\n representation on the board of directors or equivalent governing body of the investee\n participation in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends or other\ndistributions;\n material transactions between the entity and its investee;\n interchange of managerial personnel; or\n provision of essential technical information.\nThe Group has the right to appoint 1 out of 5 members of the Board of Directors (representing 20% of\nthe total voting rights) that is the governance body responsible for directing the relevant activities of\nCitadel beside having a 15% equity stake in Citadel and provision of essential technical information\nthrough the Operation & Maintenance Agreement entered with the remaining shareholders of Citadel.\nBased on above, the Group’s management believe that they have practical ability to exercise significant\ninfluence over Citadel and therefore, accounted for it as an associate as per the equity method of\naccounting.\n(b) Classification of digital assets\nAs intangible assets\nThe Group recognizes income from the provision of transaction verification services within the Bitcoin\nnetwork, commonly referred to as “cryptocurrency mining”. The Group through its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries, participates in mining pools operated by third parties in order to limit its exposure to\nvariability of mining output.",

    "content": "The Group receives bitcoins from the mining pool operator as consideration\nfor its participation in the pool.\nIncome earned from mining is measured based on the fair value of the bitcoin reward received. The fair\nvalue is derived based on the end of day average price of bitcoin, on the date of receipt, which is not\nmaterially different from the fair value at the time the Group earned the award.\nThe revenue is recognised with corresponding asset (under intangible asset) based on the delivery of\ndigital asset into the Group’s wallet once an algorithm has been solved.\n\n\nThe criteria for performance obligation is assessed to have occurred once the digital asset has been\nreceived in the Group’s wallet. Mining earnings are made up of the baseline block reward and\ntransaction fees upto 5% of total block reward, however, these are bundled together in the daily\ndeposits from mining and therefore are not capable of being analysed separately.\n3 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued)\n3.1 Significant accounting judgements (continued)\n(b) Classification of digital assets (continued)\nAs inventory\nThe Group has assessed that it acts in a capacity as a commodity-broker trader with respect to digital\nassets acquired for trading as defined in IAS 2. If assets held by commodity broker-traders are\nprincipally acquired for the purpose of selling in the near future and generating a profit from fluctuations\nin price or broker-traders’ margin, such assets are accounted for as inventory, and changes in fair value\n(less cost to sell) are recognized in consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nBy applying the principles of IAS 2, the Group treats its digital assets as inventory, measured at fair\nvalue less cost to sell. Consequently, any changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated\nstatement of profit or loss. Management believes that recognizing digital assets at fair value through the\nprofit and loss accurately reflects the economic substance of their trading activities and is in line with\nthe Group's overall strategic vision for holding these assets.\n(c) Tax\nUAE Corporate Tax\nOn 9 December 2022, the UAE Ministry of Finance released Federal Decree-Law No. 47 of 2022 on\nthe Taxation of Corporations and Businesses (Corporate Tax Law or the Law) to enact a Federal\ncorporate tax (CT) regime in the UAE. The CT regime is effective from 1 June 2023 and accordingly, it\nhas an income tax related impact on the financial statements for accounting periods beginning on or\nafter 1 June 2023. The Cabinet of Ministers Decision No. 116/2022 (published in December 2022 and\nconsidered to be effective from 16 January 2023) specifies that taxable income not exceeding AED\n375,000 would be subject to the 0% UAE CT rate, and taxable income exceeding AED 375,000 would\nbe subject to the 9% UAE CT rate. With the publication of this Decision, the UAE CT Law is considered\nto be substantively enacted for the purposes of accounting for Income Taxes. The UAE CT Law shall\napply to the Group with effect from 1 January 2024. The Ministry of Finance continues to issue\nsupplemental Decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers of the UAE (Decisions) to further clarify certain\naspects of the UAE CT Law. Such Decisions, and other interpretive guidance of the UAE Federal Tax\nAuthority, are required to fully evaluate the impact of the UAE CT Law on the Group.\nBased on the current provisions of the UAE CT Law (including interpretation based on the Ministerial\ndecisions and related guidance) and in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes, the Group has\nevaluated tax accounting impact as at the reporting date. Following assessment of the potential impact\nof the UAE CT Law on the consolidated statement of financial position, we do consider there to be a\ntemporary difference on which deferred taxes is accounted as per the CT law. The Group will continue\nto monitor the publication of subsequent decisions and related guidance, as well as continuing its more\ndetailed review of its financial matters, to consider any changes to the position at subsequent reporting\ndates.\n\n\n(d) Deferred tax assets\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable\nprofit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is\nrequired to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely\ntiming and the level of future taxable profits, together with future tax planning strategies.\nThe Group has USD 4,223 thousand (2023: nil) of tax losses carried forward. This loss relates to the\nTax Group formed between the eligible UAE entities for their first taxable period. this loss, does not\nexpire, and will be used to offset taxable income of the Tax Group once it becomes profitable.\nA deferred tax asset is recognised when it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the\ndeferred tax asset to be recovered. Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding the prudent\nforecasting of future taxable profits of the business and in applying an appropriate risk adjustment\nfactor.\nAt the end of reporting period, the management has forecast that the subsidiary would generate future\ntaxable profits against which existing tax losses could be relieved. As a result, the Group has\nrecognised a deferred tax asset of USD 380 thousand with respect to available tax losses.\n3 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued)\n3.1 Significant accounting judgements (continued)\n(e) Classification of crypto mining machines\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2024, as part of its business strategy, the Group management\nrevisited their strategy and decided to utilize mining equipment for its own use for cryptocurrency\nmining operations. As a result of this intended use, mining equipment which were previously classified\nas inventory has been reclassified to property and equipment. The mining equipment are now\nrecognized at their carrying amount as of the reclassification date, with depreciation to be recorded\nover the estimated useful life of these assets from the date of reclassification. Mining equipment are\ndepreciated over 4 years. The Group operate these machines for mining digital assets and records the\nassociated mining revenue. This reclassification reflects the Group's revised operational focus on\nself-mining, aligning the consolidated financial statement presentation with the revised business model.\nThe machines are utilised by the Group for its own operations until they are sold to customers. Upon,\nsale the machines are reclassified from property and equipment to inventories.\nBased on the business objective and purpose of purchases of machines, the Group has classified\nthese as property and equipment.\n3.2 Significant accounting estimates and assumptions\n(a) Useful lives of property and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets\nThe Group determines the estimated useful lives and related depreciation charges for its property and\nequipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets. This estimate is based on the intended use of the\nassets and the expected economic lives of those assets. It could change significantly as a result of\ntechnical innovations and competitor actions in response to severe industry cycles.\nManagement will increase the depreciation charge where useful lives are less than previously\nestimated lives, or it will write-off or write-down technically obsolete or non-strategic assets that have\nbeen abandoned or sold.\n\n\n(b) Impairment of trade receivables\nThe Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a\nlifetime expected loss allowance for trade receivables.\nThe loss allowance for trade receivables is based on assumptions about risk of default and expected\nloss rates.",

    "content": "Management uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the\nimpairment calculation which are applied to the exposure at default to arrive at the expected credit\nlosses at the reporting date. Management base their assumptions on the Group’s historical data,\nexisting market conditions as well as forward looking estimates.\nAt the reporting date, gross trade receivables were USD 28,840 thousand (2023: USD 33,062\nthousand) with a provision for expected credit losses amounting to USD 2,302 thousand (2023: USD\nNil) as at 31 December 2024 (Note 11). Any difference between the amounts actually collected in future\nperiods and the amounts expected to be received will be recognised in the consolidated statement of\nprofit or loss.\n(c) Impairment of property and equipment - mining equipment\nThe Group exercises judgment in assessing potential impairment losses related to its mining equipment\nfor recognition in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. This involves evaluating various factors,\nincluding the type of miner, hash rate capacity, and the equipment's historical performance. Such\nassessments require careful consideration of both current and projected operational efficiencies to\ndetermine whether the carrying value of the equipment exceeds its recoverable amount.\n3 Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions (continued)\n3.2 Significant accounting estimates and assumptions (continued)\n(d) Provision for obsolete and slow-moving inventories\nThe Group reviews its inventories to assess losses on account of obsolescence on a regular basis. In\ndetermining whether a provision for obsolescence should be recorded in the consolidated statement of\nprofit or loss, the Group makes judgements based on the ageing of the stocks and the past\nconsumption of the stocks, as to whether there is any observable data indicating whether individual\nproducts are saleable and indicating the net realisable value of such products. Accordingly, a provision\nfor impairment is recorded where the net realisable value is less than cost based on best estimates by\nthe management.\nInventory is regularly reviewed by the management and slow moving items, if any, are brought down to\ntheir net realisable value (NRV). NRV signifies the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of\nbusiness less the estimated costs of necessary to make the sale.\n(e) Fair value of digital assets\nManagement note that the topic of digital assets and the accounting for digital assets continues to be\nconsidered by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and continues to monitors new\ncomments and interpretations released by the Board and other standard setters from around the world.\n\n\nIn line with this, the Group has considered its position for the year ended 31 December 2024 and has\ndetermined that the Group’s digital assets fall into 2 categories:\n Intangible asset method (the method noted by the IASB in its most recent deliberations)\n Inventory method (used where the digital asset meets the criteria of inventories)\nManagement notes that under the methods noted above, the treatment continues to be to measure\ndigital assets at fair value (unless otherwise disclosed and provided certain conditions are met) under\nthe respective accounting standards.\nDigital assets are measured at fair value using the quoted price in United States dollars on from a\nnumber of different sources with the primary being Coin Market Cap (www.coinmarketcap.com) at\nclosing Coordinated Universal Time. Management considers this fair value to be a Level 1 input under\nthe IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement fair value hierarchy as the price on the quoted price (unadjusted)\nin an active market for identical assets.\nManagement uses M2 exchange in order to provide the Group with appropriate size and liquidity to\nprovide reliable evidence of fair value for the size and volume of transactions that are reasonably\ncontemplated by the Group.\n4 Financial risk management objectives and policies\nInterest rate risk\nThe Group is exposed to interest rate risk arising from its floating rate borrowings and deposits.\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with\nall other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax (through the impact on floating rate\nborrowings and short-term deposits). There is no impact on the Group’s equity.\nIncrease/decrease in basis points Net effect on profit before tax for one year\nUSD’000\n2024 +/- 100 35\n2023 +/- 100 1,944\n4 Financial risk management objectives and policies (continued)\nCredit risk\nCredit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well\nas credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.\nIndividual risk limits are based on management’s assessment on a case-by-case basis. The utilisation\nof credit limits is regularly monitored.\nThe Group’s policy is to place cash and short-term deposits with reputable banks and financial\ninstitutions.\n\n\nThe Group trades only with recognized, creditworthy third parties. Receivable balances are monitored\non an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. Credit\nrisks limited to the carrying values of financial assets in the consolidated statement of financial position.\nIts 3 (2023: 3) largest customers account for 87% (2023: 92%) of outstanding trade receivables at 31\nDecember 2024.\nImpairment of financial assets\nAs mentioned in note 2.10.6, the Group’s trade receivables are subject to the expected credit loss.\nWhile cash and short-term deposits are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, the\nGroup has determined the expected credit loss on bank balances to be insignificant considering that\nthe counterparty banks are investment grade category and have a low probability of default and loss\ngiven default.\nTo measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit\nrisk characteristics and the days past due. The loss allowance for trade receivables is based on\nassumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The expected credit loss on trade\nreceivables is determined to be insignificant. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and\nforward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the\nreceivables. The Group’s exposure through the expected credit loss is immaterial for the year ended\nand as at 31 December 2024.\nLiquidity risk\nThe Group limits its liquidity risk by ensuring bank facilities and adequate cash from operations are\navailable.\nThe table below summarises the contractual and expected maturities of the Group’s financial liabilities\nat 31 December based on undiscounted payments and current market interest rates.\nLess than 3\nmonths 3 to 12 months 1 to 5\nyears <5\nyears Total\nUSD’000 USD’000 USD’000 USD’000 USD’000\nAt 31 December 2024\nTrade payables (Note 21) 2,756 911 - - 3,667\nOther liabilities* (Note 22) - 19,506 - - 19,506\nInterest-bearing loans 16,368 353 1,882 3,284 21,887\nShareholders’ loans (Note 20) 10,000 - 12,000 - 22,000\nLease liability - 408 - - 408\nTotal 29,124 21,178 13,882 3,284 67,468\nAt 31 December 2023\nTrade payables (Note 21) - 576 - - 576\nOther liabilities* (Note 22) - 26,397 - - 26,397\nInterest-bearing loans 118 353 2,352 3,214 6,037\nLease liability - 271 409 - 680\nTotal 118 27,597 2,761 3,214 33,690\n* For the purpose of the liquidity risk disclosure, USD 7,861 thousand (2023: USD 49,991 thousand)\nhave been excluded from other liabilities related to advances received from customers and deferred\n\n\nincome.\n4 Financial risk management objectives and policies (continued)\nForeign currency risk\nForeign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will\nfluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.",

All other repairs and maintenance are\ncharged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss when incurred.\nAny revaluation increase arising on the revaluation of an asset such as building is recognised in the\nconsolidated statement of comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, except to the extent that\nit reverses a revaluation decrease for the same asset previously recognised in the consolidated\nstatement of profit or loss, in which case the increase is credited to the consolidated statement of profit\nor loss to the extent of the decrease previously expensed. A decrease in the carrying amount arising on\nthe revaluation of such asset is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss to the extent\nthat it exceeds the balance, if any, held in the properties revaluation reserve relating to a previous\nrevaluation of that asset. The incremental depreciation charge on the fair value of building is charged to\nequity under revaluation surplus and transfer to retained earnings.\nDepreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets (other than capital work in\nprogress) less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method. The estimated\nuseful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period,\nwith the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.\n\n\n5 Property and equipment (continued)\nMaterial accounting policies (continued)\nThe following useful lives are used in the calculation of depreciation:\nYears\nBuilding 40\nMining equipment 3 – 5\nData centres 30\nMachinery 15\nFurniture and fixtures 3 – 5\nOffice equipment 3\nMotor vehicle 5\nCWIP is stated at cost and is not depreciated.

Lease\nliabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable\n variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate\nas at the commencement date\n amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees\n the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and\n payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that\noption.\nLease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the\nmeasurement of the liability.\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be\nreadily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental\nborrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds\nnecessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic\nenvironment with similar terms, security and conditions.\nTo determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group:\n where possible, uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point,\nadjusted to reflect changes in financing conditions since third party financing was received.\n uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for leases held\nby the lessee which does not have recent third-party financing, and\n makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, country, currency and security.\nWhen adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is\nreassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.\n\n\nLease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the\nconsolidated statement of profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate\nof interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.\n6 Right-of-use asset and lease liability (continued)\nMaterial accounting policies (continued)\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\n the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability\n any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received,\n any initial direct costs, and\n restoration costs.\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a\nstraight-line basis. If the Group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use\nasset is depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life.\nPayments associated with short-term leases are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in\nthe consolidated statement of profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12\nmonths or less.\nA lease modification is a change in scope of the lease, or the consideration for the lease that was not\npart of the original terms of the lease.",

The cost of intangible\nassets acquired in a business combination is recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Following\ninitial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any\naccumulated impairment losses.\nThe useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.\nImpairment of intangible assets\n\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to\ndetermine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any\nsuch indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent\nof the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an\nindividual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the\nasset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate\nassets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the\nsmallest company of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can\nbe identified.

Significant influence is the\npower to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or\njoint control over those policies.\nThe considerations made in determining significant influence are similar to those necessary to\ndetermine control over subsidiaries. The results and assets and liabilities of Group’s associates are\nincorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except\nwhen the investment, or a portion thereof, is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for\n\n\nin accordance with IFRS 5.\nUnder the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognised in the consolidated\nstatement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share of the\nprofit or loss and other comprehensive income of these associate. When the Group's share of losses of\nan associate exceeds the Group's interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests\nthat, in substance, form part of the Group's net investment in the associate), the Group discontinues\nrecognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the\nGroup has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.\nAn investment in an associate is accounted for using the equity method from the date on which the\ninvestee becomes an associate. On acquisition of the investment in an associate, any excess of the\ncost of the investment over the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and\nliabilities of the investee is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the\ninvestment. Any excess of the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities\nover the cost of the investment, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in consolidated\nstatement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in the period in which the investment is\nacquired.\nWhen the Group reduces its ownership interest in an associate but the Group continues to use the\nequity method, the Group reclassifies to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or loss that had\npreviously been recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that reduction in ownership\ninterest if that gain or loss would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or\nliabilities.\n8 Investment in associates (continued)\nMaterial accounting policies (continued)\nWhen the Group transacts with an associate, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the\nassociate are recognised in the Group's consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests\nin the associate that are not related to the Group.\nThe consolidated statement of profit or loss reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the\nassociate. Any change in other comprehensive income (OCI) of those investees is presented as part of\nthe Group’s OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the\nassociate, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the consolidated\nstatement of changes in equity.\nThe aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of associates is shown on the face of the\nconsolidated statement of profit or loss.\nThe financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group.\nWhen necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.\nAfter application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an\nimpairment loss on its investment in an associate. At each reporting date, the Group determines\nwhether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired.",

    "content": "If there is such\nevidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable\namount of the associate and its carrying value, and then recognises the loss within ‘Share of\nprofit/(loss) of an associate’ in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n\n\nUpon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognises any retained\ninvestment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of\nsignificant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is\nrecognised in consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nDistributions received from an associate that exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, reduces\nthe carrying amount of investment till zero. Any excess distribution beyond this amount is assessed to\ndetermine whether the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to fund the associate’s\nlosses. If such an obligation exists, the excess distribution is recorded as a liability. If no such obligation\nexists, the excess is recognised as other income in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nSubsequently, when the associate reports profits, the Group offsets its share of those profits against\nany previously recognised liability or income from excess distributions before resuming the application\nof the equity method.\nThe balance of investment in associates in the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31\nDecember 2024 and 31 December 2023 are as follows:\nPrincipal activity 2024 2023\nUSD’000 USD'000\nInvestment in Bitzero Blockchain Inc.

Based on this additional shareholding and board\nrepresentation, management of the Group has assessed that the Group is able to exercise significant\ninfluence over Citadel and hence classified the investment as an associate. Since, this additional 7.5%\nsweat equity was acquired at Nil consideration resulting in a gain on acquisition of investment in\nassociate amounting to USD 50,906 thousand after comparison to the carrying value on the date of\nacquisition.

    "content": "Digital assets are an emerging technology and asset class, and as such there are\nno specific accounting standards that cover the treatment, rather digital assets are assessed by\napplying existing accounting standards in conjunction with guidance released by the accounting\nstandard setting bodies such as the IASB. Management considers it appropriate to group digital assets\nin the consolidated financial statements based on the underlying activities and respective recognition\ncriteria under the IFRS.\nThe fair value of digital assets on hand at the end of the reporting period is calculated as the quantity of\ndigital assets on hand multiplied with the price quoted on external market source as at the reporting\ndate. Management considers this fair value to be a level 1 input under IFRS 13 fair value measurement\nfair value hierarchy as the price source represents quoted prices on multiple digital asset exchanges,\nexcept for locked SOL which is valued in level 2 input under IFRS 13.\nThe Group consider that any digital asset that does not fall under the inventory or financial asset\nmethodology and meet the recognition criteria (identifiable, controllable and capable of generation\nfuture economic benefits) are considered to intangible assets.\nManagement has exercised judgement in determining the useful life of digital asset, whether it has\nindefinite or definite life. In order to consider indefinite life, the management considers the market\npractice of such assets, laws and regulations, industry and the economic environment in which they\noperate. Accordingly, the management concluded the life of those assets as indefinite.\n\n\nDigital assets are derecognized when the Group disposes of the asset or when the Group otherwise\nloses control and, therefore, access to the economic benefits associated with ownership of the digital\nasset. On derecognition any reserve outstanding in the equity relating to fair value of digital assets is\ntransferred to the retained earnings within equity.\n2024 2023\nUSD’000 USD’000\nDigital assets – inventory (a) 410,640 136,710\nDigital assets – intangibles (b) 30,888 3,290\n441,528 140,000\n(a) Accounted for using inventory methodology\nThe Group has determined that its holding of certain digital asset should be accounted for under IAS 2\nInventories, as it meets the definition of a commodity broker-trader. Under IAS 2, digital assets are\nmeasured at fair value less cost to sell, with changes in fair value recognized in consolidated statement\nprofit or loss. In accordance with IAS 2, commodity broker-traders are those who buy or sell\ncommodities for others or on their own account. The inventories held by commodity broker-traders are\nprincipally acquired for the purpose of selling in the future and generating a profit from fluctuations in\nprice or broker-traders’ margin. As these inventories are measured at fair value less costs to sell, they\nare excluded from only the measurement requirements of IAS 2.\n9 Digital assets (continued)\nBy applying the principles of IAS 2, the Group treats its digital assets as inventory, measured at fair\nvalue less cost to sell. Consequently, any changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated\nstatement of profit or loss. Management believes that recognizing digital assets at fair value through the\nprofit and loss accurately reflects the economic substance of their trading activities and is in line with\nthe Group's overall strategic vision for holding these assets.\n2024 2023\nUSD’000 USD’000\nAt 1 January 136,710 -\nAdditions as commodity contract (note i) 12,080 -\nAdditions (note ii) 56,065 37,200\nDisposals as commodity contract (note i) (14,987) -\n\n\nDisposals (9,182) -\nRealised gain 4,529 -\nChange in fair value - unrealised 225,425 99,510\nAt 31 December 410,640 136,710\n(i) During the year ended 31 December 2024, the Group has entered into a financing transaction with\nM2 Capital Limited (“affiliate of an associate”), where finance amount is invested in the Bitcoins (BTC)\nas commodity contract. The total of 236.16 BTC were purchased through this finance totalling to USD\n12,080 thousand. These 236.16 BTC’s were kept as collateral with M2 Capital Limited against the\nfinance amount (Note 19). On 26 August 2024, the contract was closed and the finance amount was\nfully repaid resulting in a gain of USD 2,907 thousand.\n(ii)(a) During the year ended 31 December 2024, the Group acquired 582,199 Solana tokens (SOL)\nfrom the Solana Foundation in exchange for a monetary consideration of USD 20,000 thousand. SOL\nhave a lock in period till December 2025, thereby have restrictions on selling in the primary market.\nThere is a secondary market for such portfolio of tokens such as Over The Counters (OTC) traders,\ndigital asset funds as well as family offices looking to get the exposure to digital assets at a discount.\nThese tokens are classified as inventory under the principle of broker-trader exception with the purpose\nof selling the tokens and making profits on buying and selling of such tokens. This is in line with Group’s\nbroader policy around holding of digital assets under this category.\nThe tokens are recorded at cost on acquisition and fair value is based on the available market\ninformation (adjusted for primary market conditions). The fair value gain/loss on fair valuation was\nrecorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nSince SOL tokens with lock-in period are not traded in primary market, therefore these are discounted\nat 90% and disclosed as Level 2 valuation in the consolidated financial statements in line with IFRS 13\nguidance.\n(ii)(b) During the year ended 31 December 2024, the Group has entered into the contract with Galaxy\nDigital for Solana tokens which are vested around 1.8% per month to the Group. The tokens are\ndirectly transferred to the wallet of the group. The tokens are recorded at cost on acquisition and fair\nvalue is based on the available market information. The fair value gain/ (loss) on fair valuation is\nrecorded in the consolidated statement of the profit or loss. These tokens are traded in primary market,\ntherefore these tokens are disclosed as Level 1 valuation on the consolidated financial statements in\nline with IFRS 13 guidance.\n(ii)(c) During the year ended 31 December 2024, the Group has also acquired new tokens namely FAH,\nUNCN, LVLY and ETH. The tokens were directly transferred to the wallet of the Group. The tokens\nwere recorded at cost on acquisition, except for LVLY which was received at nil consideration. The fair\nvalue gain/ (loss) on fair valuation is recorded in the consolidated statement of the profit or loss. These\ntokens are traded in primary market, therefore these tokens are disclosed as Level 1 valuation on the\nconsolidated financial statements in line with IFRS 13 guidance.\n9 Digital assets (continued)\n(b) Accounted for using intangible asset methodology\nThe Group carries out mining of digital assets and recognizes revenue in relation to assets through\nmining activity with corresponding recognition of intangible assets under IAS 38, Intangible Assets.\n\n\nSuch intangible assets have an indefinite useful life, initially measured at cost, deemed to be the fair\nvalue upon receipt, and subsequently measured under the revaluation model. Under the revaluation\nmodel, increases or decreases in the digital asset’s carrying amount is recognized in consolidated\nstatement of comprehensive income and the revaluation reserve in equity, unless it reverses valuation\ndeficit of the same asset previously recognised in consolidated statement of profit or loss. A revaluation\ndeficit is recognised in consolidated statement of profit or loss, except to the extent that it offsets an\nexisting surplus on the same asset recognised in the revaluation reserve.",

Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional\nunless they contain significant financing components, when they are recognised at fair value. The\nGroup holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore\nmeasures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\nThe Group’s trade receivables are subject to the expected credit loss model. The Group applies the\nIFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss\nallowance for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have\nbeen grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.\nTrade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that\nthere is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to\nengage in a repayment plan with the Group.\nImpairment losses on trade receivables are presented as net impairment losses within operating profit.\nSubsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item.\nReceivables for which an impairment provision was recognised were written off against the provision\nwhen there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.\n2024 2023\nUSD’000 USD’000\nGross - trade receivables 28,840 33,062\nProvision for expected credit losses (2,302) -\nNet trade receivables 26,538 33,062\nAt 31 December 2024, trade receivables at nominal value of USD 65 thousand (2023: USD Nil) were\nimpaired (note 30).\n\n\nOut of the above balance of trade receivables, USD 190 thousand (2023: USD 4,802 thousand) relates\nto a related party (note 17(i)(a)).\n11 Trade receivables (continued)\nThe movement of the provision for expected credit losses is as follows:\n2024 2023\nUSD’000 USD’000\nAt 1 January - 1,366\nCharge / (reversal) for the year (Note 30) 2,302 (1,366)\nAt 31 December 2,302 -\n12 Advances, deposits and other receivables\n2024 2023\nUSD’000 USD’000\nAdvance to suppliers (i) (ii) 143,418 132,111\nDeposits 15,190 31,664\nAccrued income - 273\nVAT receivable 1,159 183\nPrepaid expenses 5,171 172\nOther receivables 395 108\nOthers 42 8\n165,375 164,519\n(i) This includes balance of USD 94,236 thousand (2023: USD 46,317 thousand) given to a related\nparty (Note 17 (i) (d)).\n(ii) This includes a balance of USD 1,500 thousand for the investment to be made in IOPN Limited.\nDuring the year, the Group has written off receivables amounting to USD Nil (2023: USD 2,985\nthousand).

Where the\namount of consideration received from a customer exceeds the amount of revenue recognised this\ngives rise to a contract liability.\nRevenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account\ncontractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes and duty.\nRevenue is recognised to the extent it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and\nthe revenue and costs, if applicable, can be measured reliably.\nThe Group does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the\npromised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a\nconsequence, the Group does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration which the Group expects to be entitled in\nexchange for transferring promised goods or services to the customer. The consideration expected by\nthe Group may include fixed or variable amounts. Revenue is recognized when it transfers control over\ngoods and services to the customer and only when it is highly probable that a significant reversal of\nrevenue will not occur when uncertainties related to a variable consideration are resolved.\nPerformance obligation\nInformation about the Group’s performance obligations are summarised below:\n(i) Mined income\nThe Group recognizes income from the provision of transaction verification services within the Bitcoin\nnetwork, commonly referred to as “cryptocurrency mining”. The Group participates in mining pools\noperated by third parties in order to limit its exposure to variability of mining output. The Group receives\nbitcoins from the mining pool operator as consideration for its participation in the pool.\nIncome earned from mining is measured based on the fair value of the bitcoin reward received. The\ntransaction price is the fair value of crypto mined, being the fair value per the prevailing market rate for\nthat crypto currency on the transaction date, and this is allocated to the number of crypto mined. The\nfair value is derived based on the end of day average price of bitcoin, on the date of receipt, which is\n\n\nnot materially different from the fair value at the time the Group earned the award. The revenue is\nrecognised with corresponding asset under intangible asset based on the delivery of digital asset into\nthe Group’s wallet once an algorithm has been solved. The criteria for performance obligation is\nassessed to have occurred once the digital asset has been received in the Group’s wallet once an\nalgorithm has been solved. Mining earnings are made up of the baseline block reward and transaction\nfees upto a certain % of total block reward, however, these are bundled together in the daily deposits\nfrom mining and therefore are not capable of being analysed separately.\n(ii) Hosting Revenue\nThe Group recognised management fees on the services provided to third parties for management of\nmining machines on their behalf, ensuring the machines are optimised and mining as efficiently as\npossible.\nManagement fee is recognized from the hosting contract between the Group and its customers under\nIFRS 15. The performance obligations include providing hosting facilities with defined electricity rates,\nensuring uptime within contractual limits, and other services such as repair and maintenance as\ndefined in the contract. The transaction price is based on the electricity rates agreed with the customer.\nRevenue should be recognized in overtime monthly intervals, as the performance obligations in the\nhosting contracts are satisfied during the period in which services are provided.\n25 Revenue from contracts with customers (continued)\n(iii) Revenue from sale of ASICs, wallets, and equipment\nRevenue from the sale of goods and services in normal course of business is recognised either at a\npoint in time or over time.\nThe Group recognises revenue over time if one of the following criteria is met:\n The customer simultaneously receives and consumes all of the benefits provided by the entity as the\nGroup performs;\n The Group’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is\ncreated or;\n The Group’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity\nhas an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.\nIf an entity does not satisfy its performance obligation over time, it satisfies it at point of time.\nRevenue from the sale of goods and services is therefore recognised at a point in time or over time\nwhen the performance obligation is satisfied and is based on the amount of the transaction price that is\nallocated to the performance obligation. The transaction price is the amount of consideration which the\nGroup expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods and services to the\ncustomers.\nThe consideration expected by the Group may include fixed or variable amounts. Revenue is\nrecognised when it transfers control over goods and services to the customer and only when it is highly\nprobable that a significant reversal of the revenue will not occur when uncertainties related to a variable\nconsideration are resolved.\nTransfer of control varies depending on the individual terms of the contract of sale.",
