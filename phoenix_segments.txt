The Directors have the pleasure in submitting this report, together with the audited consolidated
financial statements of the Phoenix Group PLC (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively
referred to as the “Group”) for the year ended 31 December 2024.
Principal activities
The Group is a technology conglomerate bringing cutting-edge blockchain solutions to an expansive
market. The Group offers a comprehensive range of services, from high-performance computing
machines trading and data centre hosting. The Group develops, operates, and manages highly
specialised data centres, hosting high performance computing power for digital asset across the UAE,
Oman, USA and Canada. Additionally, the Group also hosts, operates and maintains equipment within
its existing data centres and enables investment opportunities within cloud mining.
The Group is the exclusive distributor of industry-leading equipment manufacturer MicroBT and
prominent distributor of Digital wallet Ledgers and CoolWallets, across the Middle East. The Group has
four business verticals including trading, hosting, mining and investments.
Results for the year
For the year ended 31 December 2024, the Group reported revenue of USD 205,686 thousand (2023:
USD 288,187 thousand) and profit for the year attributable to the shareholders of USD 167,372
thousand (2023: USD 207,780 thousand).
The variance in revenue between 2024 and 2023 is primarily due to a 72% decrease in trading
revenue, a 36% decrease in hosting revenue, and a significant 236% increase in self-mining revenue.
This aligns with our strategic focus on enhancing self-mining operations to drive revenue growth. The
total comprehensive income for the period is USD 218,832 thousand as compared to USD 220,936
thousand in 2023. Earnings per share is decreased from USD 0.040 in 2023 to USD 0.028 in 2024. The
total assets grew from USD 834,005 thousand in 2023 to USD 962,371 thousand in 2024.
Transactions with related parties
Related party transactions are carried out as part of our normal course of business and in compliance
with applicable laws and regulations. Related party transactions are disclosed in note 17 of the
consolidated financial statements.
Role of the Directors


The Directors are the Group's principal decision-making forum. The Directors have the overall
responsibility for leading and supervising the Group for delivering sustainable shareholder value
through their guidance and supervision of the Group's business. The Directors set the strategies and
policies of the Group. They monitor performance of the Group's business, guide and supervise its
management.
Going concern
The attached consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. While
preparing the consolidated financial statements, the management has made an assessment of the
Group's ability to continue as a going concern. The management has made significant assumptions
over mining and sale of digital assets to generate sufficient cash flows in foreseeable future to meet its
obligations as and when they fall due. The management has not come across any evidence other than
disclosed above that causes it to believe that material uncertainties related to the events or conditions
existed, which may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.
Statement of Directors' responsibilities
The applicable requirements require the Directors to prepare the consolidated financial statements for
each financial year which present fairly in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the
Group and its financial performance for the year then ended.
The consolidated financial statements for the year have been prepared in conformity and in compliance
with the relevant statutory requirements and other governing laws. The Directors confirm that sufficient
care has been taken for the maintenance of proper and adequate accounting records that disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time, the consolidated financial position of the Group and enables them to
ensure that the consolidated financial statements comply with the requirements of the applicable
statute. The Directors also confirm that appropriate accounting policies have been selected and applied
consistently in order for the consolidated financial statements to reflect fairly, the form and substance of
the transactions carried out during the year under review and reasonably present the Group's financial
conditions and results of its operations.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To: The Shareholders of Phoenix Group PLC
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Phoenix Group PLC (the “Company”) and its
subsidiaries (together the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as
at 31 December 2024, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of
cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including
material accounting policy information.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2024, and its consolidated
financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with IFRS
Accounting Standards.
Basis for Opinion


We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the
Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group
in accordance with the International code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International
Independence Standards) (the “IESBA Code”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant
to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in the United Arab Emirates, and we have fulfilled
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code.

=== SEGMENT 2 (6860 chars) ===
We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.
Emphasis of Matter
We draw attention to Note 2 in the consolidated financial statements, which states that the consolidated
financial statements have been prepared under the going concern basis of accounting, based on the
significant assumption that the Group is able to generate sufficient cash flows in the foreseeable future
to meet its obligations as and when they fall due through the mining and sale of digital assets. Our
opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our
audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in
the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Recognition of cryptocurrency mining revenue (Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements)
Key audit matter:
The Group recognises revenue in accordance with IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The management recognises revenue from the provision of transaction verification services within the
Bitcoin network, commonly referred to as “cryptocurrency mining”. The Group participates in mining
pools operated by third parties in order to limit its exposure to variability of mining output. The Group
receives bitcoins from the mining pool operator as consideration for its participation in the pool.
During the year ended 31 December 2024, the Group recognised cryptocurrency mining revenue of
USD 106.8 million. The Group’s management has exercised significant judgment in their determination
of how IFRS 15 should be applied to the accounting for cryptocurrency mining revenue recognised.
We identified the accounting for cryptocurrency mining revenue recognised as a key audit matter due to
the complexities involved in auditing completeness and occurrence of the revenue recognised by the
Group.
How the matter was addressed in our audit:
We have performed audit procedures to obtain assurance over the revenue from mining which included
the following:
■ Obtained and evaluated management’s rationale for the application of IFRS 15 to account for its
cryptocurrency awards earned;
■ Performed substantive transactional testing of income recognised, by vouching a sample of
transactions from the Group’s digital wallets to the Bitcoin blockchain, and recalculating the fair value
on recognition;
■ Vouched a sample of transactions directly from the Bitcoin blockchain back to the Group’s digital
wallets;
■ Evaluated and tested management’s rationale and supporting documentation associated with the
valuation of cryptocurrency awards earned; and
■ Assessed the adequacy of disclosures in line with the requirements of the IFRS.


Accounting for digital assets (Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements)
Key audit matter:
The Group holds number of digital assets as intangible assets and inventories as disclosed in note 9 of
the consolidated financial statements.
There is no specific accounting standard that addresses the accounting treatment for digital assets and
as a result significant judgement is applied to ensure these digital assets are accounted for in
accordance with the IFRS Accounting Standards.
This was determined to be a key audit matter as it requires significant judgement in determining the
recognition and presentation of the digital assets and confirming existence at reporting date.
How the matter was addressed in our audit:
We have performed audit procedures in respect to the management’s assessment by performing the
following procedures:
■ Confirmed the quantities of the digital assets within the Group’s wallets by inspecting wallets at
yearend;
■ Reviewed and tested underlying agreements giving rise to the receipt of digital assets;
■ Performed an assessment of the fair values attributed to the digital assets at the transaction date and
year end date, by vouching the value of quantities held to a third party website;
■ Performed an assessment of the liquidity of the tokens held and any impact on the subsequent
measurement thereto;
■ Discussed with management the strategy for holding of digital assets and reviewed the relevant
accounting treatment; and
■ Assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
Related Party Transactions and Disclosures (Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements)
Key audit matter:
The Group entered into frequent and significant transactions with related parties. These includes loans
from related parties, acquisition of digital assets, and sales and purchases to and from related parties
as disclosed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
We identified related party transactions and disclosure as a key audit matter due to the inherent risk
involved in the identification of related party transactions, which, combined with the frequency and
significance of such transactions, requires significant auditor’s attention in performing the audit.
How the matter was addressed in our audit :
We have performed audit procedures to address the key audit matter:
■ Reviewed management’s process for identifying and disclosing related party relationships and
transactions;
■ Reviewed underlying agreements, invoices, and supporting documentation to assess the nature of
transactions;
■ Held discussions with management and those charged with governance regarding significant related
party transactions and their commercial rationale; and
■ Assessed the adequacy of the disclosure in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
Other Information
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors’
report, and information included in Annual Report (but does not include the consolidated financial
statements and our auditor’s report thereon). We obtained the Directors’ Report prior to the date of our
auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do
not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the
other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with


the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to
be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we
obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of
this other information, we are required to report that fact.

=== SEGMENT 3 (7677 chars) ===
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial
Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards and in compliance with the applicable
provisions of the Abu Dhabi Global Market Companies Regulation 2020, and for such internal control
as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with Governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting
process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users
taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
■ Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.
■ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
■ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management.
■ Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to
the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,


to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a
going concern.
■ Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
■ Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the
financial information of the entities or business units within the Group to as a basis for forming an
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and
review of the audit work performed for purposes of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for
our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with Governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant
ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions
taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that
were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences
of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such
communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
Further, as required by the the Abu Dhabi Global Market Companies Regulations 2020 of ADGM, we
report that:
■ the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in, all material respects, in accordance
with the applicable requirements of the Companies Regulations 2020 of ADGM; and
■ the financial information included in the Directors' report, is consistent with the consolidated financial
statements of the Group.

2 Summary of material accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements
are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless
otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation
Statement of compliance


These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting
Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and comply where
appropriate, with the Articles of Association, the applicable requirements of Abu Dhabi Global Market
(“ADGM”) Companies Regulations 2020 and Companies Regulations (International Accounting
Standards) Rules 2015 issued by Abu Dhabi Global Market.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS Accounting Standards
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its
judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher
degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the
consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 3.
Basis of measurement
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for
digital assets and building, which are measured at fair value. Historical cost is generally based on the
fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets.
Going Concern
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared on a going concern basis, as
management is confident in the Group's ability to continue its business activities and settle its financial
obligations as and when they fall due. In assessing the appropriateness of the going concern basis of
accounting, management has prepared cash flow forecasts for the next 12 months from the reporting
date. The cash flow forecasts include certain key assumptions regarding the estimated cash inflows
from realisation on sale of digital assets as defined in note 9, these digital assets are subject to market
volatility of crypto industry.
The Group's management remains confident in its ability to navigate the volatility associated with digital
assets and has demonstrated effective liquidity management through the utilization of these assets for
daily operational expenses. This proactive approach highlights management's commitment to
maintaining the Group's financial stability and ensuring the continuity of operations.
2.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
(a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The Group applied for the first-time certain standards and amendments, which are effective for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024. The Group has not early adopted any other standard,
interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective:
 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants
(Amendments to IAS 1)
 Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1)
 Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16)
 Supplier Finance Arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7)
These standards and amendments had no significant impact on the consolidated financial statements
of the Group.
2 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)


2.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures (continued)
(b) Standards issued but not yet effective
The new and amended standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the
date of issuance of the Group’s consolidated financial statements are disclosed below.

=== SEGMENT 7 (7565 chars) ===
The Group
intends to adopt these new and amended standards and interpretations, if applicable, when they
become effective.
 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (IFRS 18)
 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures (IFRS 19)
 Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments (Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7)
 Lack of exchangeability (Amendments to IAS 21)
 Sale or contribution of assets between and investor and its associate or joint venture (Amendments to
IFRS 10
and IAS 28)
 Amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards (Improvements to Volume 11)
 Contracts Referencing Nature-dependent Electricity (Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7)
The Group does not expect that the adoption of these new and amended standards and interpretations
will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
2.3 Consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases
when the Company loses control of the subsidiary. Control is achieved when the Company has all of
the following elements:
 power over the investee, i.e. the investor has existing rights that give it the ability to direct the relevant
activities (the activities that significantly affect the investee’s returns)
 exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee
 the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns.
Specifically, the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in
consolidated statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income from the date the Company gains
control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the consolidated financial statements of subsidiaries to
bring the accounting policies used into line with the Group’s accounting policies.
All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions
between the members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
All financial statements are made up to 31 December 2024. When necessary, amounts reported by
subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform with the Group’s accounting policies.
The principal accounting policies applied in these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
2.4 Foreign currency translation


(a) Functional and presentation currency
The consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in US Dollars (“USD”), which is the
Group’s presentation currency, and all the values are recorded to the nearest thousand (`000), except
when otherwise indicated. Each component determines its functional currency and items included in
the financial statements of these companies are measured using that functional currency.
2 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
2.4 Foreign currency translation (continued)
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currencies using the
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the
translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Foreign exchange
gains and losses are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional
currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date.
Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in the consolidated
statement of profit or loss with the exception of monetary items that are designated as part of the
Group’s net investment in a foreign operation. These are recognized in consolidated statement of
comprehensive income (OCI) until the net investment is disposed of, at which time, the cumulative
amount is reclassified to profit or loss. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on
those monetary items are also recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI).
(c) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a
hyper-inflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
 assets and liabilities for each consolidated statement of financial position presented are translated at
the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
 income and expenses for each consolidated statement of profit or loss and consolidated statement of
comprehensive income are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in
which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
 all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in the
foreign currency translation reserve (“FCTR”) in equity. However, if the foreign operation is a
non-wholly owned subsidiary, then the relevant proportion of the translation difference is allocated to
non-controlling interests. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence
or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation
is reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation
while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to


non-controlling interests.
When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in associate that includes a foreign operation
while retaining significant influence, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to
the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a
foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are
considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognized in other
comprehensive income and are presented within equity in the FCTR.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed through
acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and
translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Exchange differences
are recognized in other comprehensive income.

2.10 Financial instruments
2.10.1 Financial assets
The Group has the following financial assets: ‘due from related parties’, ‘cash and short-term deposits’,
‘trade receivables’ and ‘deposits and other receivables’.

=== SEGMENT 8 (7095 chars) ===
The classification depends on the nature and
purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Cash and short-term deposits
Cash and short-term deposits include cash in hand, cash at bank and short-term deposits varying from
one day to three months.
Classification of financial assets
Financial assets


All financial assets under scope of IFRS 9 are required to be subsequently measured at amortised cost
or fair value on the basis of the Group’s business model for managing the financial assets and
contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets.
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost, if both the following conditions are met:
 the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order
to collect contractual cash flows; and
 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
A financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, if both of the following
conditions are met:
 the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
A financial asset is measured at fair value through profit or loss, unless it is measured at amortised cost
or at fair value through other comprehensive income. However, the Group may make an irrevocable
election at initial recognition for particular investments in equity instruments that would otherwise be
measured at fair value through profit or loss to present subsequent changes in fair value in other
comprehensive income.
2 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
2.10 Financial instruments (continued)
2.10.2 Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for:
 financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities, including derivatives that are
liabilities, are subsequently measured at fair value;
 financial liabilities that arise when a transfer of a financial asset does not qualify for derecognition or
when the continuing involvement approach applies;
 financial guarantee contracts; and
 commitments to provide a loan at a below-market interest rate.
At initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial liability as measured at fair value
through profit or loss when permitted, or when doing so results in more relevant information, because
either:
 it eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred
to ‘as an accounting mismatch') that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or
recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases; or
 a group of financial liabilities or financial assets and financial liabilities is managed and its
performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or
investment strategy, and information about the Group is provided internally on that basis to the entity's
key management personnel.


Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are
discharged, cancelled or they expire.
2.10.3 Offsetting
Financial assets and financial liabilities are only offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated
statement of financial position when there is legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts
and the Group intends to settle on a net basis.
2.10.4 Recognition and derecognition
Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date on which
the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to
receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has
transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
2.10.5 Measurement
At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a
financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly
attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at
FVTPL are expensed in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
2.10.6 Impairment
The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt
instruments carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there
has been a significant increase in credit risk.
For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires
expected lifetime losses to be recognized from initial recognition of the receivables, see note 3.2 for
further details.
2 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
2.11 Trade receivables
Refer Note 11.
2.12 Digital assets
Refer Note 9.
2.13 Cash and short-term deposits
Refer Note 13.
2.14 Trade payables
Refer note 21.


2.15 Taxation
The tax expense / credit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
(a) Current income tax
Current tax expense (or benefit) is the tax payable (or receivable) on the current year’s taxable income
calculated using tax rates (and laws) enacted at the end of the reporting period in the countries where
the Group’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Current tax is recognised on the income statement except when the tax relates to items directly
recognised in other comprehensive income or equity, in which case it is recognised in other
comprehensive income or in equity respectively.
Tax provisions are recognised for uncertain tax positions when it is probable that there will be a future
outflow of funds to tax authority, measured at the best estimate of the amount expected to become
payable.
(b) Deferred tax
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an
asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit nor loss. Also deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if
they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill in a business combination. Deferred income tax is
determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted in the
jurisdiction of the individual companies by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply
when the related deferred income tax liability is settled or the deferred income tax asset is realised.

=== SEGMENT 9 (7880 chars) ===
A
provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive
obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be
required to settle the obligation.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and
associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the
Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will
be available, against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities offset when:
 a legally enforceable right exists to offset current income tax assets against current income tax
liabilities,
 the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation
authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to
settle the balances on a net basis.
2 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
2.15 Taxation (continued)
(c) Value added tax (VAT)


Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of VAT, except:
1. When the VAT incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation
authority, in which case, the VAT is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part
of the expense item, as applicable; or
2. When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of VAT included.
The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of
receivables or payables in the consolidated statement of financial position.
2.16 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has an obligation (legal or constructive) arising from a past
event, and the costs to settle the obligation are both probable and able to be reliably measured.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of
a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the
present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties
surrounding the obligation. When a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the
present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of the
time value of money is material).
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered
from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will
be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
2.17 Employees’ end of service benefits
Refer Note 18.
2.18 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:
 the profit attributable to owners of the Company, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than
ordinary shares; and
 by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for
bonus elements and share split in ordinary shares issued during the year and excluding treasury
shares.
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to
take into account:
 the after-income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential
ordinary shares; and
 the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding,
assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.


2 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
2.19 Interest-bearing loans
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the liabilities are
derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
2.20 Shareholders’ loan
The Shareholder’s loan was received as non-interest bearing. The initial recognition is made at fair
value by discounting the cash flows at the borrowing rate of the Group. The difference between the
amount received and the fair value is recognised in equity.

2.25 Current versus non-current classification
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position based on
current/non-current classification. An asset is current when it is:
 Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle;
 Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
 Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period; or
 Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least
twelve months after the reporting period.
All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is current when:
 It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle;
 It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;


 It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the
reporting period.
3 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses,
assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the reporting date. However,
uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a
material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in the future periods.
3.1 Significant accounting judgements
(a) Classification of an investment in an associate
For assessing significant influence, the Group has assessed if there is evidence of one or more of the
following ways of having significant influence in the Citadel Technologies Group LLC (“Citadel”):
 representation on the board of directors or equivalent governing body of the investee
 participation in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends or other
distributions;
 material transactions between the entity and its investee;
 interchange of managerial personnel; or
 provision of essential technical information.
The Group has the right to appoint 1 out of 5 members of the Board of Directors (representing 20% of
the total voting rights) that is the governance body responsible for directing the relevant activities of
Citadel beside having a 15% equity stake in Citadel and provision of essential technical information
through the Operation & Maintenance Agreement entered with the remaining shareholders of Citadel.
Based on above, the Group’s management believe that they have practical ability to exercise significant
influence over Citadel and therefore, accounted for it as an associate as per the equity method of
accounting.
(b) Classification of digital assets
As intangible assets
The Group recognizes income from the provision of transaction verification services within the Bitcoin
network, commonly referred to as “cryptocurrency mining”. The Group through its wholly owned
subsidiaries, participates in mining pools operated by third parties in order to limit its exposure to
variability of mining output.

=== SEGMENT 10 (7871 chars) ===
The Group receives bitcoins from the mining pool operator as consideration
for its participation in the pool.
Income earned from mining is measured based on the fair value of the bitcoin reward received. The fair
value is derived based on the end of day average price of bitcoin, on the date of receipt, which is not
materially different from the fair value at the time the Group earned the award.
The revenue is recognised with corresponding asset (under intangible asset) based on the delivery of
digital asset into the Group’s wallet once an algorithm has been solved.


The criteria for performance obligation is assessed to have occurred once the digital asset has been
received in the Group’s wallet. Mining earnings are made up of the baseline block reward and
transaction fees upto 5% of total block reward, however, these are bundled together in the daily
deposits from mining and therefore are not capable of being analysed separately.
3 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued)
3.1 Significant accounting judgements (continued)
(b) Classification of digital assets (continued)
As inventory
The Group has assessed that it acts in a capacity as a commodity-broker trader with respect to digital
assets acquired for trading as defined in IAS 2. If assets held by commodity broker-traders are
principally acquired for the purpose of selling in the near future and generating a profit from fluctuations
in price or broker-traders’ margin, such assets are accounted for as inventory, and changes in fair value
(less cost to sell) are recognized in consolidated statement of profit or loss.
By applying the principles of IAS 2, the Group treats its digital assets as inventory, measured at fair
value less cost to sell. Consequently, any changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated
statement of profit or loss. Management believes that recognizing digital assets at fair value through the
profit and loss accurately reflects the economic substance of their trading activities and is in line with
the Group's overall strategic vision for holding these assets.
(c) Tax
UAE Corporate Tax
On 9 December 2022, the UAE Ministry of Finance released Federal Decree-Law No. 47 of 2022 on
the Taxation of Corporations and Businesses (Corporate Tax Law or the Law) to enact a Federal
corporate tax (CT) regime in the UAE. The CT regime is effective from 1 June 2023 and accordingly, it
has an income tax related impact on the financial statements for accounting periods beginning on or
after 1 June 2023. The Cabinet of Ministers Decision No. 116/2022 (published in December 2022 and
considered to be effective from 16 January 2023) specifies that taxable income not exceeding AED
375,000 would be subject to the 0% UAE CT rate, and taxable income exceeding AED 375,000 would
be subject to the 9% UAE CT rate. With the publication of this Decision, the UAE CT Law is considered
to be substantively enacted for the purposes of accounting for Income Taxes. The UAE CT Law shall
apply to the Group with effect from 1 January 2024. The Ministry of Finance continues to issue
supplemental Decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers of the UAE (Decisions) to further clarify certain
aspects of the UAE CT Law. Such Decisions, and other interpretive guidance of the UAE Federal Tax
Authority, are required to fully evaluate the impact of the UAE CT Law on the Group.
Based on the current provisions of the UAE CT Law (including interpretation based on the Ministerial
decisions and related guidance) and in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes, the Group has
evaluated tax accounting impact as at the reporting date. Following assessment of the potential impact
of the UAE CT Law on the consolidated statement of financial position, we do consider there to be a
temporary difference on which deferred taxes is accounted as per the CT law. The Group will continue
to monitor the publication of subsequent decisions and related guidance, as well as continuing its more
detailed review of its financial matters, to consider any changes to the position at subsequent reporting
dates.


(d) Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable
profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is
required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely
timing and the level of future taxable profits, together with future tax planning strategies.
The Group has USD 4,223 thousand (2023: nil) of tax losses carried forward. This loss relates to the
Tax Group formed between the eligible UAE entities for their first taxable period. this loss, does not
expire, and will be used to offset taxable income of the Tax Group once it becomes profitable.
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the
deferred tax asset to be recovered. Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding the prudent
forecasting of future taxable profits of the business and in applying an appropriate risk adjustment
factor.
At the end of reporting period, the management has forecast that the subsidiary would generate future
taxable profits against which existing tax losses could be relieved. As a result, the Group has
recognised a deferred tax asset of USD 380 thousand with respect to available tax losses.
3 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued)
3.1 Significant accounting judgements (continued)
(e) Classification of crypto mining machines
During the year ended 31 December 2024, as part of its business strategy, the Group management
revisited their strategy and decided to utilize mining equipment for its own use for cryptocurrency
mining operations. As a result of this intended use, mining equipment which were previously classified
as inventory has been reclassified to property and equipment. The mining equipment are now
recognized at their carrying amount as of the reclassification date, with depreciation to be recorded
over the estimated useful life of these assets from the date of reclassification. Mining equipment are
depreciated over 4 years. The Group operate these machines for mining digital assets and records the
associated mining revenue. This reclassification reflects the Group's revised operational focus on
self-mining, aligning the consolidated financial statement presentation with the revised business model.
The machines are utilised by the Group for its own operations until they are sold to customers. Upon,
sale the machines are reclassified from property and equipment to inventories.
Based on the business objective and purpose of purchases of machines, the Group has classified
these as property and equipment.
3.2 Significant accounting estimates and assumptions
(a) Useful lives of property and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets
The Group determines the estimated useful lives and related depreciation charges for its property and
equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets. This estimate is based on the intended use of the
assets and the expected economic lives of those assets. It could change significantly as a result of
technical innovations and competitor actions in response to severe industry cycles.
Management will increase the depreciation charge where useful lives are less than previously
estimated lives, or it will write-off or write-down technically obsolete or non-strategic assets that have
been abandoned or sold.


(b) Impairment of trade receivables
The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for trade receivables.
The loss allowance for trade receivables is based on assumptions about risk of default and expected
loss rates.

=== SEGMENT 11 (7964 chars) ===
Management uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the
impairment calculation which are applied to the exposure at default to arrive at the expected credit
losses at the reporting date. Management base their assumptions on the Group’s historical data,
existing market conditions as well as forward looking estimates.
At the reporting date, gross trade receivables were USD 28,840 thousand (2023: USD 33,062
thousand) with a provision for expected credit losses amounting to USD 2,302 thousand (2023: USD
Nil) as at 31 December 2024 (Note 11). Any difference between the amounts actually collected in future
periods and the amounts expected to be received will be recognised in the consolidated statement of
profit or loss.
(c) Impairment of property and equipment - mining equipment
The Group exercises judgment in assessing potential impairment losses related to its mining equipment
for recognition in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. This involves evaluating various factors,
including the type of miner, hash rate capacity, and the equipment's historical performance. Such
assessments require careful consideration of both current and projected operational efficiencies to
determine whether the carrying value of the equipment exceeds its recoverable amount.
3 Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions (continued)
3.2 Significant accounting estimates and assumptions (continued)
(d) Provision for obsolete and slow-moving inventories
The Group reviews its inventories to assess losses on account of obsolescence on a regular basis. In
determining whether a provision for obsolescence should be recorded in the consolidated statement of
profit or loss, the Group makes judgements based on the ageing of the stocks and the past
consumption of the stocks, as to whether there is any observable data indicating whether individual
products are saleable and indicating the net realisable value of such products. Accordingly, a provision
for impairment is recorded where the net realisable value is less than cost based on best estimates by
the management.
Inventory is regularly reviewed by the management and slow moving items, if any, are brought down to
their net realisable value (NRV). NRV signifies the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of
business less the estimated costs of necessary to make the sale.
(e) Fair value of digital assets
Management note that the topic of digital assets and the accounting for digital assets continues to be
considered by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and continues to monitors new
comments and interpretations released by the Board and other standard setters from around the world.


In line with this, the Group has considered its position for the year ended 31 December 2024 and has
determined that the Group’s digital assets fall into 2 categories:
 Intangible asset method (the method noted by the IASB in its most recent deliberations)
 Inventory method (used where the digital asset meets the criteria of inventories)
Management notes that under the methods noted above, the treatment continues to be to measure
digital assets at fair value (unless otherwise disclosed and provided certain conditions are met) under
the respective accounting standards.
Digital assets are measured at fair value using the quoted price in United States dollars on from a
number of different sources with the primary being Coin Market Cap (www.coinmarketcap.com) at
closing Coordinated Universal Time. Management considers this fair value to be a Level 1 input under
the IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement fair value hierarchy as the price on the quoted price (unadjusted)
in an active market for identical assets.
Management uses M2 exchange in order to provide the Group with appropriate size and liquidity to
provide reliable evidence of fair value for the size and volume of transactions that are reasonably
contemplated by the Group.
4 Financial risk management objectives and policies
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk arising from its floating rate borrowings and deposits.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with
all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax (through the impact on floating rate
borrowings and short-term deposits). There is no impact on the Group’s equity.
Increase/decrease in basis points Net effect on profit before tax for one year
USD’000
2024 +/- 100 35
2023 +/- 100 1,944
4 Financial risk management objectives and policies (continued)
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well
as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
Individual risk limits are based on management’s assessment on a case-by-case basis. The utilisation
of credit limits is regularly monitored.
The Group’s policy is to place cash and short-term deposits with reputable banks and financial
institutions.


The Group trades only with recognized, creditworthy third parties. Receivable balances are monitored
on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. Credit
risks limited to the carrying values of financial assets in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Its 3 (2023: 3) largest customers account for 87% (2023: 92%) of outstanding trade receivables at 31
December 2024.
Impairment of financial assets
As mentioned in note 2.10.6, the Group’s trade receivables are subject to the expected credit loss.
While cash and short-term deposits are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, the
Group has determined the expected credit loss on bank balances to be insignificant considering that
the counterparty banks are investment grade category and have a low probability of default and loss
given default.
To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit
risk characteristics and the days past due. The loss allowance for trade receivables is based on
assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The expected credit loss on trade
receivables is determined to be insignificant. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and
forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the
receivables. The Group’s exposure through the expected credit loss is immaterial for the year ended
and as at 31 December 2024.
Liquidity risk
The Group limits its liquidity risk by ensuring bank facilities and adequate cash from operations are
available.
The table below summarises the contractual and expected maturities of the Group’s financial liabilities
at 31 December based on undiscounted payments and current market interest rates.

4 Financial risk management objectives and policies (continued)
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.

=== SEGMENT 12 (7662 chars) ===
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in
foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s operating activities (when revenue or expense
are denominated in a different currency from the functional currency), financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss and the Group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The Group has an exposure on its foreign currency transactions mainly from UK Pounds (GBP) and
United Arab Emirates Dirham (UAE Dirham). As the UAE Dirham is pegged to the US Dollar, any
balances in US Dollars, so UAE Dirham currency is not considered to represent significant currency
risk.
At 31 December 2024, the Group does not have material foreign currency risk.
Other risk
The Group is exposed to price risk arising from prices of the digital assets. Prices fluctuates based on
the supply and demand of MMX, SOL, UNCN, LYLY, ETH, FAH coins and Bitcoins that may result in
reductions in profit before tax. There can be no set predictions at a level that provides assurance of the
same or similar prices, and any reduction in the prices on the said digital assets would have a material
adverse impact on the results of operations and financial position.

one year Effect on other comprehensive income for
one year
USD’000 USD’000
2024 +/-1 4,106 308
2023 +/- 1 1,367 33
Capital management
Whilst the continuity of the Group’s long-term investment program depends on the availability of the
financing from the Shareholders, the management’s objective is to generate necessary operating cash
flows to sustain day to day activities of the Group.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total equity plus net debt.
The Group includes within net debt, interest-bearing loans, interest-free loan, lease liability, less cash
and short-term deposits. Capital includes issued share capital, share premium, other reserves,
contribution from shareholders, and retained earnings.

Fair value estimation
The fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between
knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. Consequently, differences can arise
between carrying values and the fair value estimates.
While the Group prepares its consolidated financial statements under the historical cost convention in
the opinion of management, the carrying values and fair values of those financial assets and liabilities
that are not carried at fair value in the consolidated financial statements are not materially different,
since assets and liabilities are either short term in nature or frequently repriced.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial
instruments by valuation technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value
are observable, either directly or indirectly; and
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are
not based on observable market data.
4 Financial risk management objectives and policies (continued)
Fair value estimation (continued)
The below table shows the hierarchy used by the Group for the assets and liabilities that are measured
at fair value or for which fair value information is disclosed as at 31 December 2024 and 2023:


Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total
USD’000 USD’000 USD’000 USD’000

Digital assets (Note 9) 140,000 - - 140,000
140,000 21,704 - 161,704
On a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the
hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. During the year ended 31
December 2024 and 2023, there are no transfers between the levels of fair value measurements.
5 Property and equipment
Material accounting policies
Property and equipment except for building are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
impairment loss, if any. Building stated at revalued amount, which is the fair value at the date of
revaluation. Subsequently, these are stated at revalued amounts less subsequent impairment losses, if
any.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to
the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are
charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss when incurred.
Any revaluation increase arising on the revaluation of an asset such as building is recognised in the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, except to the extent that
it reverses a revaluation decrease for the same asset previously recognised in the consolidated
statement of profit or loss, in which case the increase is credited to the consolidated statement of profit
or loss to the extent of the decrease previously expensed. A decrease in the carrying amount arising on
the revaluation of such asset is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss to the extent
that it exceeds the balance, if any, held in the properties revaluation reserve relating to a previous
revaluation of that asset. The incremental depreciation charge on the fair value of building is charged to
equity under revaluation surplus and transfer to retained earnings.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets (other than capital work in
progress) less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method. The estimated
useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period,
with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.


5 Property and equipment (continued)
Material accounting policies (continued)
The following useful lives are used in the calculation of depreciation:
Years
Building 40
Mining equipment 3 – 5
Data centres 30
Machinery 15
Furniture and fixtures 3 – 5
Office equipment 3
Motor vehicle 5
CWIP is stated at cost and is not depreciated. These costs are directly attributable to the construction,
development, or acquisition activities these costs include:
 Direct materials, labor, and overhead costs, and
 Directly attributable indirect costs that meet the recognition criteria outlined in IAS 16 Property, Plant
and Equipment.
Capitalization commences when expenditures are incurred for the construction, development, or
acquisition of the asset.

=== SEGMENT 13 (7842 chars) ===
Capitalization ceases when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its
intended use or sale.
CWIP is recognized as an asset on the consolidated statement of financial position when the following
criteria are met:
a) Expenditures are incurred for the construction, development, or acquisition of a long-term asset,
b) The asset is not yet ready for its intended use or sale, and
c) Future economic benefits are expected to flow to the Group.
The carrying values of property and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists and
where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to
their recoverable amount, being the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and their value in use.
If the building was measured using the cost model the carrying amount would be as follows:
2024 2023
USD’000 USD’000
Cost 10,324 10,324
Accumulated depreciation (774) (516)
Carrying amount 9,550 9,808

5.1 The fair values were determined with reference to market-based evidence, based on active market
prices and relevant enquiries and information as considered necessary, and adjusted for any difference
in nature, location or condition of the specific properties. The fair value of said lands falls under level 2
of fair value hierarchy (i.e. significant observable inputs).
5.2 During the year, two new asset classes i.e., data centres and machinery were introduced upon
completion of capital work in progress (CWIP). Therefore, USD 97,125 thousand has been reclassified
from CWIP to these asset classes. The useful life of data centres and machinery are determined as 30
years and 15 years respectively, over which these assets will be depreciated.
5 Property and equipment (continued)
5.3 During the year, mining equipment costing USD 19,866 thousand gross of depreciation and
accumulated depreciation of USD 2,237 thousand is transferred to inventory. The transfer is made as


per the policy, refer note 3.1 (e).
5.4 CWIP pertains to data centers which are under construction in the USA. The management of the
Group expect the projects relating to capital work-in-progress to complete by end of first quarter of
2025.
5.5 During the year, mining equipment has been transferred from inventory to property and equipment,
as a result, an amount of USD 87,811 thousand has been reclassified from inventory to property and
equipment and depreciation charge of USD 9,985 thousand has been recognised during the year. The
reclassification is made in line with the Group’s policy, refer note note 3.1 (e).
5.6 During the year, CWIP amounting to USD 7,588 thousand was reclassified to other asset classes
i.e., USD 5,534 thousand was transferred to deposits, USD 1,812 thousand to inventories, and USD
242 thousand to intangible assets.
6 Right-of-use asset and lease liability
Material accounting policies
Leases, where the Group is a lessee, are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease
liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group.
Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease
liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:
 fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable
 variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate
as at the commencement date
 amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees
 the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and
 payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that
option.
Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the
measurement of the liability.
The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be
readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental
borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds
necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic
environment with similar terms, security and conditions.
To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group:
 where possible, uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point,
adjusted to reflect changes in financing conditions since third party financing was received.
 uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for leases held
by the lessee which does not have recent third-party financing, and
 makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, country, currency and security.
When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is
reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.


Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the
consolidated statement of profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
6 Right-of-use asset and lease liability (continued)
Material accounting policies (continued)
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:
 the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability
 any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received,
 any initial direct costs, and
 restoration costs.
Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a
straight-line basis. If the Group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use
asset is depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life.
Payments associated with short-term leases are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in
the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12
months or less.
A lease modification is a change in scope of the lease, or the consideration for the lease that was not
part of the original terms of the lease.

=== SEGMENT 14 (7701 chars) ===
When a modification increases the scope of the lease adding
more underlying assets and the consideration is commensurate, the modification is accounted as a
separate lease contract. However, if a modification increases the scope of the lease without adding the
right to use of more underlying assets, or the increase in lease consideration is not commensurate, the
modification is accounted for by remeasuring the existing lease.

7 Intangible assets
Material accounting policies
Intangible assets comprise of the Group’s digital mining website, mining pool, multicoin mining pool and
mobile application with a useful lives of 3 years.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible
assets acquired in a business combination is recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Following
initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any
accumulated impairment losses.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Impairment of intangible assets


At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent
of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an
individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the
asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate
assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the
smallest company of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can
be identified. Management has not identified any impairment indicators relating to the intangible assets.

8 Investment in associates
Material accounting policies
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally
accompanying a shareholding between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Significant influence is the
power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or
joint control over those policies.
The considerations made in determining significant influence are similar to those necessary to
determine control over subsidiaries. The results and assets and liabilities of Group’s associates are
incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except
when the investment, or a portion thereof, is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for


in accordance with IFRS 5.
Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognised in the consolidated
statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share of the
profit or loss and other comprehensive income of these associate. When the Group's share of losses of
an associate exceeds the Group's interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests
that, in substance, form part of the Group's net investment in the associate), the Group discontinues
recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the
Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
An investment in an associate is accounted for using the equity method from the date on which the
investee becomes an associate. On acquisition of the investment in an associate, any excess of the
cost of the investment over the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and
liabilities of the investee is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the
investment. Any excess of the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities
over the cost of the investment, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in consolidated
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in the period in which the investment is
acquired.
When the Group reduces its ownership interest in an associate but the Group continues to use the
equity method, the Group reclassifies to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or loss that had
previously been recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that reduction in ownership
interest if that gain or loss would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or
liabilities.
8 Investment in associates (continued)
Material accounting policies (continued)
When the Group transacts with an associate, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the
associate are recognised in the Group's consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests
in the associate that are not related to the Group.
The consolidated statement of profit or loss reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the
associate. Any change in other comprehensive income (OCI) of those investees is presented as part of
the Group’s OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the
associate, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the consolidated
statement of changes in equity.
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of associates is shown on the face of the
consolidated statement of profit or loss.
The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group.
When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an
impairment loss on its investment in an associate. At each reporting date, the Group determines
whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired.

=== SEGMENT 15 (7844 chars) ===
If there is such
evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable
amount of the associate and its carrying value, and then recognises the loss within ‘Share of
profit/(loss) of an associate’ in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.


Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognises any retained
investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of
significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is
recognised in consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Distributions received from an associate that exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, reduces
the carrying amount of investment till zero. Any excess distribution beyond this amount is assessed to
determine whether the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to fund the associate’s
losses. If such an obligation exists, the excess distribution is recorded as a liability. If no such obligation
exists, the excess is recognised as other income in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Subsequently, when the associate reports profits, the Group offsets its share of those profits against
any previously recognised liability or income from excess distributions before resuming the application
of the equity method.
The balance of investment in associates in the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31
December 2024 and 31 December 2023 are as follows:

(i) On October 12, 2023, beside the existing 7.5% shareholding in Citadel (classified as investment
carried at FVPTL amounting to USD 43,952 thousand), the Group was awarded sweat equity of
additional 7.5% of the ordinary share capital of the Citadel along with one board representation on
Citadel out of the 5 board members of Citadel. Based on this additional shareholding and board
representation, management of the Group has assessed that the Group is able to exercise significant
influence over Citadel and hence classified the investment as an associate. Since, this additional 7.5%
sweat equity was acquired at Nil consideration resulting in a gain on acquisition of investment in
associate amounting to USD 50,906 thousand after comparison to the carrying value on the date of
acquisition. In October 2024, the purchase price allocation for Citadel was completed. The Group
recorded its additional 7.5% acquisition in 2023 at a fair value that is consistent with the fair value
determined during the Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) process. The 2023 comparative information
was not adjusted for the provisional amounts, as there is no difference.
(ii) The Group’s share of loss includes loss of USD 6,177 thousand from Citadel, whereas its share of
other comprehensive income from the same entity amounted to USD 39,663 thousand, primarily due to
revaluation of digital assets.

9 Digital assets
Material accounting policies
Digital assets are assets such as MMX, FAH, LVLY, SOL and UNCN coins, which use an open-source
software-based online system where transactions are recorded in a public ledger (blockchain) using its
own unit of account.

=== SEGMENT 16 (7767 chars) ===
Digital assets are an emerging technology and asset class, and as such there are
no specific accounting standards that cover the treatment, rather digital assets are assessed by
applying existing accounting standards in conjunction with guidance released by the accounting
standard setting bodies such as the IASB. Management considers it appropriate to group digital assets
in the consolidated financial statements based on the underlying activities and respective recognition
criteria under the IFRS.
The fair value of digital assets on hand at the end of the reporting period is calculated as the quantity of
digital assets on hand multiplied with the price quoted on external market source as at the reporting
date. Management considers this fair value to be a level 1 input under IFRS 13 fair value measurement
fair value hierarchy as the price source represents quoted prices on multiple digital asset exchanges,
except for locked SOL which is valued in level 2 input under IFRS 13.
The Group consider that any digital asset that does not fall under the inventory or financial asset
methodology and meet the recognition criteria (identifiable, controllable and capable of generation
future economic benefits) are considered to intangible assets.
Management has exercised judgement in determining the useful life of digital asset, whether it has
indefinite or definite life. In order to consider indefinite life, the management considers the market
practice of such assets, laws and regulations, industry and the economic environment in which they
operate. Accordingly, the management concluded the life of those assets as indefinite.


Digital assets are derecognized when the Group disposes of the asset or when the Group otherwise
loses control and, therefore, access to the economic benefits associated with ownership of the digital
asset. On derecognition any reserve outstanding in the equity relating to fair value of digital assets is
transferred to the retained earnings within equity.

Digital assets – intangibles (b) 30,888 3,290
441,528 140,000
(a) Accounted for using inventory methodology
The Group has determined that its holding of certain digital asset should be accounted for under IAS 2
Inventories, as it meets the definition of a commodity broker-trader. Under IAS 2, digital assets are
measured at fair value less cost to sell, with changes in fair value recognized in consolidated statement
profit or loss. In accordance with IAS 2, commodity broker-traders are those who buy or sell
commodities for others or on their own account. The inventories held by commodity broker-traders are
principally acquired for the purpose of selling in the future and generating a profit from fluctuations in
price or broker-traders’ margin. As these inventories are measured at fair value less costs to sell, they
are excluded from only the measurement requirements of IAS 2.
9 Digital assets (continued)
By applying the principles of IAS 2, the Group treats its digital assets as inventory, measured at fair
value less cost to sell. Consequently, any changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated
statement of profit or loss. Management believes that recognizing digital assets at fair value through the
profit and loss accurately reflects the economic substance of their trading activities and is in line with
the Group's overall strategic vision for holding these assets.

(i) During the year ended 31 December 2024, the Group has entered into a financing transaction with
M2 Capital Limited (“affiliate of an associate”), where finance amount is invested in the Bitcoins (BTC)
as commodity contract. The total of 236.16 BTC were purchased through this finance totalling to USD
12,080 thousand. These 236.16 BTC’s were kept as collateral with M2 Capital Limited against the
finance amount (Note 19). On 26 August 2024, the contract was closed and the finance amount was
fully repaid resulting in a gain of USD 2,907 thousand.
(ii)(a) During the year ended 31 December 2024, the Group acquired 582,199 Solana tokens (SOL)
from the Solana Foundation in exchange for a monetary consideration of USD 20,000 thousand. SOL
have a lock in period till December 2025, thereby have restrictions on selling in the primary market.
There is a secondary market for such portfolio of tokens such as Over The Counters (OTC) traders,
digital asset funds as well as family offices looking to get the exposure to digital assets at a discount.
These tokens are classified as inventory under the principle of broker-trader exception with the purpose
of selling the tokens and making profits on buying and selling of such tokens. This is in line with Group’s
broader policy around holding of digital assets under this category.
The tokens are recorded at cost on acquisition and fair value is based on the available market
information (adjusted for primary market conditions). The fair value gain/loss on fair valuation was
recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Since SOL tokens with lock-in period are not traded in primary market, therefore these are discounted
at 90% and disclosed as Level 2 valuation in the consolidated financial statements in line with IFRS 13
guidance.
(ii)(b) During the year ended 31 December 2024, the Group has entered into the contract with Galaxy
Digital for Solana tokens which are vested around 1.8% per month to the Group. The tokens are
directly transferred to the wallet of the group. The tokens are recorded at cost on acquisition and fair
value is based on the available market information. The fair value gain/ (loss) on fair valuation is
recorded in the consolidated statement of the profit or loss. These tokens are traded in primary market,
therefore these tokens are disclosed as Level 1 valuation on the consolidated financial statements in
line with IFRS 13 guidance.
(ii)(c) During the year ended 31 December 2024, the Group has also acquired new tokens namely FAH,
UNCN, LVLY and ETH. The tokens were directly transferred to the wallet of the Group. The tokens
were recorded at cost on acquisition, except for LVLY which was received at nil consideration. The fair
value gain/ (loss) on fair valuation is recorded in the consolidated statement of the profit or loss. These
tokens are traded in primary market, therefore these tokens are disclosed as Level 1 valuation on the
consolidated financial statements in line with IFRS 13 guidance.
9 Digital assets (continued)
(b) Accounted for using intangible asset methodology
The Group carries out mining of digital assets and recognizes revenue in relation to assets through
mining activity with corresponding recognition of intangible assets under IAS 38, Intangible Assets.


Such intangible assets have an indefinite useful life, initially measured at cost, deemed to be the fair
value upon receipt, and subsequently measured under the revaluation model. Under the revaluation
model, increases or decreases in the digital asset’s carrying amount is recognized in consolidated
statement of comprehensive income and the revaluation reserve in equity, unless it reverses valuation
deficit of the same asset previously recognised in consolidated statement of profit or loss. A revaluation
deficit is recognised in consolidated statement of profit or loss, except to the extent that it offsets an
existing surplus on the same asset recognised in the revaluation reserve.

The total digital assets portfolio amounts to USD 441,528 thousand, which includes liquid digital assets
valued at USD 30,888 thousand. These are classified as intangible assets to comply with the Group’s
accounting policy for digital assets. The Group actively utilises USDT in its daily operations, allowing for
efficient management of its financial resources. Given the high liquidity of USDT (Tether) and BTC
(Bitcoin) these are regarded as highly liquid digital assets that can be quickly converted into fiat
currency with minimal transaction costs. USDT is specifically designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the
US dollar, offering price stability. The Group has the flexibility to convert BTC into USDT, and
subsequently USDT into USD, as needed to support its liquidity requirements. This is part of Group's
active treasury management.
10 Inventories
Material accounting policies
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and other costs incurred in bringing
them to their existing location and condition. The cost of inventories is based on the weighted average
cost method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of
completion and costs necessary to make the sale.

11 Trade receivables
Material accounting policies
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method, less provision for expected credit losses.
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for services performed in the ordinary course of
business. Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional
unless they contain significant financing components, when they are recognised at fair value. The
Group holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore
measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The Group’s trade receivables are subject to the expected credit loss model. The Group applies the
IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss
allowance for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have
been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.
Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that
there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to
engage in a repayment plan with the Group.
Impairment losses on trade receivables are presented as net impairment losses within operating profit.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item.
Receivables for which an impairment provision was recognised were written off against the provision
when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.

During the year, the Group has written off receivables amounting to USD Nil (2023: USD 2,985

estimated to be immaterial for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2024.

mining equipment with a value of USD 123,634 thousand were also reclassified from current advances

13 Cash and short-term deposits
Material accounting policies
Cash and short-term deposits in the consolidated statement of financial position comprise of cash at
banks and on hand and short-term highly liquid deposits with a maturity of three months or less, that
are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and are readily convertible to a
known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash
and short-term deposits, as defined above, as they are considered an integral part of the Group’s cash
management.
Cash and short-term deposits in the consolidated statements of financial position and cash flows
consist of the following:
2024 2023
USD’000 USD’000
Cash at bank and on hand 20,310 23,165
Short-term deposits – less than three months original maturity - 175,000
20,310 198,165
Cash at banks earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates. Short-term deposits
are made for varying periods of between one day and three months, depending on the immediate cash
requirements of the Group, and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.


The expected credit loss on bank balances is estimated to be immaterial as the Group only deals with
reputable banks with good ratings.
The total digital assets portfolio amounts to USD 441,528 thousand, which includes liquid digital assets
valued at USD 30,888 thousand. These are classified as intangible assets to comply with relevant IFRS
Accounting Standards. The Group actively utilises USDT in its daily operations, allowing for efficient
management of its financial resources. Given the high liquidity of USDT (Tether) and BTC (Bitcoin)
these are regarded as highly liquid digital assets that can be quickly converted into fiat currency with
minimal transaction costs. USDT is specifically designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar,
offering price stability. The Group has the flexibility to convert BTC into USDT, and subsequently USDT
into USD, as needed to support its liquidity requirements. This is part of Group's active treasury
management.
14 Share capital, share premium and other reserves
Material accounting policies
i) Share capital and share premium
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
The transaction costs associated with issuance of new shares and stock exchange listing are
accounted for as follows:
 Incremental costs that are directly attributable to issuing new shares is deducted from equity; and
 Costs that relate to the stock market listing or are otherwise not incremental and directly attributable to
issuing new shares, are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Costs
that relate to both share issuance and listing are allocated between those functions on a rational and
consistent basis. In the absence of a more specific basis for apportionment, an allocation of common
costs based on the proportion of new shares issued to the total number of (new and existing) shares
listed is applied.

25 Revenue from contracts with customers
Material accounting policies
Revenue from contracts with customers
The Group recognises revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in
IFRS 15:
Step 1 Identify contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more
parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract that
must be met.
Step 2 Identify performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a
contract with a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer.
Step 3 Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which
the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer,
excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.
Step 4 Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that
has more than one performance obligation, the Group allocates the transaction price to each
performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group
expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation.
Step 5 Recognise revenue when (or as) the Group satisfies a performance obligation.


The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognises revenue over time, if one of the following
criteria is met:
a) The Group’s performance does not create an asset with an alternate use to the Group and the Group
has as an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
b) The Group’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is
created or enhanced.
c) The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group’s
performance as the Group performs.
25 Revenue from contracts with customers (continued)
Material accounting policies (continued)
For performance obligations where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognised at
the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied.
When the Group satisfies a performance obligation by delivering the promised goods or services it
creates a contract-based asset on the amount of consideration earned by the performance. Where the
amount of consideration received from a customer exceeds the amount of revenue recognised this
gives rise to a contract liability.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account
contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes and duty.
Revenue is recognised to the extent it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and
the revenue and costs, if applicable, can be measured reliably.
The Group does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the
promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a
consequence, the Group does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.
The transaction price is the amount of consideration which the Group expects to be entitled in
exchange for transferring promised goods or services to the customer. The consideration expected by
the Group may include fixed or variable amounts. Revenue is recognized when it transfers control over
goods and services to the customer and only when it is highly probable that a significant reversal of
revenue will not occur when uncertainties related to a variable consideration are resolved.
Performance obligation
Information about the Group’s performance obligations are summarised below:
(i) Mined income
The Group recognizes income from the provision of transaction verification services within the Bitcoin
network, commonly referred to as “cryptocurrency mining”. The Group participates in mining pools
operated by third parties in order to limit its exposure to variability of mining output. The Group receives
bitcoins from the mining pool operator as consideration for its participation in the pool.
Income earned from mining is measured based on the fair value of the bitcoin reward received. The
transaction price is the fair value of crypto mined, being the fair value per the prevailing market rate for
that crypto currency on the transaction date, and this is allocated to the number of crypto mined. The
fair value is derived based on the end of day average price of bitcoin, on the date of receipt, which is


not materially different from the fair value at the time the Group earned the award. The revenue is
recognised with corresponding asset under intangible asset based on the delivery of digital asset into
the Group’s wallet once an algorithm has been solved. The criteria for performance obligation is
assessed to have occurred once the digital asset has been received in the Group’s wallet once an
algorithm has been solved. Mining earnings are made up of the baseline block reward and transaction
fees upto a certain % of total block reward, however, these are bundled together in the daily deposits
from mining and therefore are not capable of being analysed separately.
(ii) Hosting Revenue
The Group recognised management fees on the services provided to third parties for management of
mining machines on their behalf, ensuring the machines are optimised and mining as efficiently as
possible.
Management fee is recognized from the hosting contract between the Group and its customers under
IFRS 15. The performance obligations include providing hosting facilities with defined electricity rates,
ensuring uptime within contractual limits, and other services such as repair and maintenance as
defined in the contract. The transaction price is based on the electricity rates agreed with the customer.
Revenue should be recognized in overtime monthly intervals, as the performance obligations in the
hosting contracts are satisfied during the period in which services are provided.
25 Revenue from contracts with customers (continued)
(iii) Revenue from sale of ASICs, wallets, and equipment
Revenue from the sale of goods and services in normal course of business is recognised either at a
point in time or over time.
The Group recognises revenue over time if one of the following criteria is met:
 The customer simultaneously receives and consumes all of the benefits provided by the entity as the
Group performs;
 The Group’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is
created or;
 The Group’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity
has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
If an entity does not satisfy its performance obligation over time, it satisfies it at point of time.
Revenue from the sale of goods and services is therefore recognised at a point in time or over time
when the performance obligation is satisfied and is based on the amount of the transaction price that is
allocated to the performance obligation. The transaction price is the amount of consideration which the
Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods and services to the
customers.
The consideration expected by the Group may include fixed or variable amounts. Revenue is
recognised when it transfers control over goods and services to the customer and only when it is highly
probable that a significant reversal of the revenue will not occur when uncertainties related to a variable
consideration are resolved.
Transfer of control varies depending on the individual terms of the contract of sale.

=== SEGMENT 22 (7629 chars) ===
Revenue from
transactions that have distinct goods and services are accounted for separately based on their
stand-alone selling prices. A variable consideration is recognised to the extent it is highly probable that


a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the
uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
The Group mainly deals in trading of ASICs, wallets, and equipment. The performance obligations are
satisfied at a point in time upon delivery of goods to the customers.
Below is the disaggregation of the Group’s revenue from contracts with customers:

27 Other income
Material accounting policies
The Group recognises income from coupon sale, finance income, income earned on provision and
intellectual service and miscellaneous income as income when respective performance obligations are
satisfied.
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested with banks. Finance income is
recognised as it accrues in consolidated statement of comprehensive income using the effective

coupons for the purchase and use of S19 mining machines from Bitman Development PTE. These
credits are provided to the Group after it purchases cutting edge Bitcoin mining machines. The credits
are transferable. The Group elects to sells the credits at the market rate to willing buyers upon receipt
