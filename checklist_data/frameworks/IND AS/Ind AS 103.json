The amount of any issue costs not recognised as an expense and how they were recognised shall also be disclosed; (n) in a bargain purchase (in accordance with paragraphs 103.34–103.36A): (i) the amount of any gain recognised in other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 103.34; (ii) the amount of any gain directly recognised in equity in accordance with paragraph 103.36A; and (iii) a description of the reasons why the transaction resulted in a gain in case of (i) above; (o) for each business combination in which the acquirer holds less than 100 per cent of the equity interests in the acquiree at the acquisition date: (i) the amount of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree recognised at the acquisition date and the measurement basis for that amount; and (ii) for each non-controlling interest in an acquiree measured at fair value, the valuation technique(s) and significant inputs used to measure that value; (p) in a business combination achieved in stages: (i) the acquisition-date fair value of the equity interest in the acquiree held by the acquirer immediately before the acquisition date; and (ii) the amount of any gain or loss recognised as a result of remeasuring to fair value the equity interest in the acquiree held by the acquirer before the business combination (paragraph 103.42) and the line item in the statement of profit and loss in which that gain or loss is recognised; (q) the following information: (i) the amounts of revenue and profit or loss of the acquiree since the acquisition date included in the consolidated statement of profit and loss for the reporting period; and (ii) the revenue and profit or loss of the combined entity for the current reporting period as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the year had been as of the beginning of the annual reporting period. If disclosure of any of the information required by this subparagraph is impracticable, disclosure by the acquirer of that fact and explanation why the disclosure is impracticable. This Ind AS uses the term ‘impracticable’ with the same meaning as in Ind AS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors."
