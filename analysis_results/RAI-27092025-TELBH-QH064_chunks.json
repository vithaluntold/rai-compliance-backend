Our \nresponsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the \nAudit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the \nGroup in accordance with the International code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including \nInternational Independence Standards) (the “IESBA Code”) together with the ethical requirements \nthat are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in the United Arab Emirates, \nand we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the \nIESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to \nprovide a basis for our opinion. \n \nEmphasis of Matter \n \nWe draw attention to Note 2 in the consolidated financial statements, which states that the \nconsolidated financial statements have been prepared under the going concern basis of accounting, \nbased on the significant assumption that the Group is able to generate sufficient cash flows in the \nforeseeable future to meet its obligations as and when they fall due through the mining and sale of \ndigital assets. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. \n \nKey Audit Matters \n \nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in \nour audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were \naddressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in \nforming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n--- PAGE BREAK ---\n\nRAI LLP, Registration No. 000006218.

The Group participates in \nmining pools operated by third parties in order to limit its exposure to variability of mining output. \nThe Group receives bitcoins from the mining pool operator as consideration for its participation in \nthe pool. \nDuring the year ended 31 December 2024, the Group recognised cryptocurrency mining revenue \nof USD 106.8 million. The Group’s management has exercised significant judgment in their \ndetermination of how IFRS 15 should be applied to the accounting for cryptocurrency mining \nrevenue recognised. \nWe identified the accounting for cryptocurrency mining revenue recognised as a key audit matter \ndue to the complexities involved in auditing completeness and occurrence of the revenue \nrecognised by the Group. \nHow the matter was addressed in our audit: \nWe have performed audit procedures to obtain assurance over the revenue from mining which \nincluded the following: \n \nObtained and evaluated management’s rationale for the application of IFRS 15 to account for \nits cryptocurrency awards earned; \n \nPerformed substantive transactional testing of income recognised, by vouching a sample of \ntransactions from the Group’s digital wallets to the Bitcoin blockchain, and recalculating the fair \nvalue on recognition; \n \nVouched a sample of transactions directly from the Bitcoin blockchain back to the Group’s \ndigital wallets; \n \nEvaluated and tested management’s rationale and supporting documentation associated with \nthe valuation of cryptocurrency awards earned; and \n \n Assessed the adequacy of disclosures in line with the requirements of the IFRS. \n \nAccounting for digital assets (Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) \nKey audit matter: \nThe Group holds number of digital assets as intangible assets and inventories as disclosed in note \n9 of the consolidated financial statements. \nThere is no specific accounting standard that addresses the accounting treatment for digital assets \nand as a result significant judgement is applied to ensure these digital assets are accounted for in \naccordance with the IFRS Accounting Standards. \nThis was determined to be a key audit matter as it requires significant judgement in determining the \nrecognition and presentation of the digital assets and confirming existence at reporting date.\n\n--- PAGE BREAK ---\n\nRAI LLP, Registration No. 000006218.

These includes \nloans from related parties, acquisition of digital assets, and sales and purchases to and from related \nparties as disclosed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. \nWe identified related party transactions and disclosure as a key audit matter due to the inherent risk \ninvolved in the identification of related party transactions, which, combined with the frequency and \nsignificance of such transactions, requires significant auditor’s attention in performing the audit. \nHow the matter was addressed in our audit: \nWe have performed audit procedures to address the key audit matter: \n \nReviewed management’s process for identifying and disclosing related party relationships and \ntransactions; \n \nReviewed \nunderlying \nagreements, \ninvoices, \nbalance \nconfirmations \nand \nsupporting \ndocumentation to assess the nature of transactions; \n \nHeld discussions with management and those charged with governance regarding significant \nrelated party transactions and their commercial rationale; and \n \nAssessed the adequacy of the disclosure in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. \n \nOther Information \n \nManagement is responsible for the other information.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information \nthat we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material \nmisstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report \nin this regard. \n \nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated \nFinancial Statements \n \nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial \nstatements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards and in compliance with the applicable \nprovisions of the Abu Dhabi Global Market Companies Regulation 2020, and for such internal control \nas management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial \nstatements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \n \nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the \nGroup’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going \nconcern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to \nliquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. \n \nThose charged with Governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting \nprocess. \n \nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements \n \nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements \nas a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s \nreport that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a \nguarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement \nwhen it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually \nor in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users \ntaken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. \n \nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain \nprofessional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n \n \nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, \nwhether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, \nand obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. \nThe risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one \nresulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, \nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal control.",
